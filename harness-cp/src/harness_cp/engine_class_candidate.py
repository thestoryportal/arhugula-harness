"""Per-deployment-surface engine-class candidate mapping — U-CP-16.

Implements C-CP-07 §7.2 (per-deployment-surface candidate mapping). Declares
the `EngineClassCandidate` record and the 3-entry `ENGINE_CLASS_CANDIDATES`
constant — one candidate set per `DeploymentSurface`, with the structural
exclusion reasons per excluded `EngineClass`.

**Carrier note.** `DeploymentSurface` is the cross-axis foundational enum
declared at `harness_core.deployment_surface` (U-CORE-01) — consumed by the
IS / AS / CP / OD axes. It is imported from `harness-core`, not re-declared:
the plan U-CP-16 Signatures block displays a `DeploymentSurface` enum, but
`harness-core` already carries it byte-exact (3 values: `local-development`,
`self-hosted-server`, `managed-cloud`) per the single-carrier discipline
(`CLAUDE.md` §3.3). Re-declaring it would make `pyright` treat the per-unit
copies as distinct nominal types and break cross-unit composition.

`EngineClass` is the U-CP-15 5-value taxonomy (`harness_cp.engine_class`).

**Candidate sets.** The `candidate_set` per surface follows the U-CP-16
acceptance #2 table — the §7.2-grounded structural-exclusion reading: every
engine class is a candidate at a surface *unless* §7.2's cell-exclusion
discipline structurally rejects it. `RECONCILER_LOOP` is excluded at
`local-development` (requires a K8s control plane); `PURE_PATTERN_NO_ENGINE` is
excluded at `self-hosted-server` and `managed-cloud` (the durable pole at a
server/managed context requires a durability primitive — §7.2 "pure-pattern-
no-engine excluded for durable pole"). Specific recommended candidates *within*
each set are operator-discretion per the §7.2 deferred list.

verbatim through v2.6 — no body rewrite); Spec_Control_Plane_v1_2.md §7
