# Implementation Plan — H_E Autonomous Loop + Parallel Lanes v1

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. In this workspace each unit lands through `/roadmap-continue` → `/ship-pr` (CLAUDE.md §12); the per-unit commit steps below are the commits inside that arc, not a substitute for it.

**Goal:** Build the H_E autonomous loop's correctness floor and measurement substrate so N ≥ 2 lanes can build concurrently in isolated worktrees and land through exactly one merge door, exactly as `.harness/spec/Spec_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1.md` (35 contracts, `C-HE-01`…`C-HE-35`) commits.

**Architecture:** Filesystem-CAS coordination only (exclusive create + atomic rename under the shared `QUEUE_DIR`), no daemon, no lock. Three durable coordination records — closure-time queue entries (existing), generation-versioned per-arc reservations (new, `tools/reservations.py`), and a single merge-door lease with a transition-marker family (new, `tools/merge_door.py`) — plus one finding record (`tools/finding_record.py`) that every gate, reviewer wrapper, and detection emits into `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`. Reviewer verdicts count only under a positive schema parse in a fail-closed wrapper (`tools/review_wrapper_common.py`); the merge door is fenced structurally by `tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh` + `permission-guard.sh` and server-side by branch protection.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 stdlib (`json`, `os`, `subprocess`, `hashlib`, `dataclasses`), `jsonschema` 4.26 (already a workspace dep) for verdict/record schemas, `pyyaml` for reading `ci.yml`; bash for hooks/skills (`tools/hooks/*.sh`); `just` recipes; `pytest` for `tools/test_*.py`; the existing `tools/mutation_probe.py` for RED-first witnesses. **No new frameworks** (CLAUDE.md §3.2).

## Global Constraints

Copied verbatim from the spec; every unit's requirements implicitly include these.

- Namespace: `C-HE-*` governs **H_E dev tooling only**; nothing here extends the H_T design (spec §0.2). Posture: **mode-agnostic** workspace-operational (CLAUDE.md §11.2). No `design-substrate/**` edits anywhere in this plan.
- "All cross-lane coordination state MUST be established by filesystem CAS: atomic exclusive create (`publish_exclusive`, `arc_metrics.py:516`, or `os.link` onto a fresh name) and atomic rename (`os.replace`). No `flock`/`fcntl` locks" (C-HE-02 §1). Invariant: `rg -c 'flock|fcntl' tools/arc_metrics.py tools/merge_door.py tools/reservations.py` → 0.
- "Every coordination file MUST live `QUEUE_DIR`-adjacent (shared, outside `REPO`) and MUST NOT live under `REPO`" (C-HE-02 §2). `QUEUE_DIR` = `ARC_METRICS_QUEUE_DIR`, default `~/.gstack/projects/arhugula-v2/arc-metrics-queue`.
- "No exclusive gate MAY be held across an unbounded network call" (C-HE-02 §3): every `gh` call made under a hold carries a bounded timeout and reconciles by ground truth on timeout.
- "Coordination MUST NOT use a daemon, spawner, coordinator process, or merge-queue lock" (C-HE-01 §3, L-2).
- "**No tier reclaims on elapsed time**" (C-HE-03 §5, C-HE-20 §2, D8): the 24 h TTL is a notification threshold only.
- "A verdict COUNTS only if the channel's output parses to that channel's declared schema. Exit code is never a completion signal" (C-HE-15 §1). Terminal states of a review invocation are exactly `{APPROVE, BLOCK, REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE}` (C-HE-16 §3).
- "CANCELLED is INCOMPLETE, never green" (C-HE-19 §1).
- "No new **authority**: no new hash-chained findings ledger" (C-HE-23 §1); `.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl` carries only `record_kind=arc` rows; finding-class rows live in `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` (C-HE-24 §2).
- `lane_id`, `producer`, `reviewer_identity`, `deterministic_check_id` MUST NOT contain `:` (C-HE-03 §3, C-HE-24 §2).
- "No flat round cap anywhere" (C-HE-21 §1); "No mechanized check is ever cited as grounds for a round cap" (C-HE-31 inv).
- Every verification line marked **mutation-probe** MUST go RED against the unfixed guard and GREEN after the fix, confirmed via `just mutation-probe` (spec §0.3). `just mutation-probe-coverage-check` asserts coverage before a contract closes (§8.1).
- Skip policy (§8.1): only `docker-daemon-absent`, `provider-login-absent`, `gh-auth-absent` may skip, each with the named reason; a skipped **phase0** row fails `just lanes-phase0-check`. No row may skip on "slow".
- The plan MUST cite `C-HE-NN`, never the design corpus (spec §13); it MUST NOT be consumed before the clearance marker `.harness/clearance/spec-he-loop-lanes-v1-cleared-<date>.md` exists (spec §14).
- Repo conventions: `uv run pytest tools/test_X.py -q` for Python tests; `bash tools/hooks/test_X.sh` for hook tests; every new `tools/test_*.py` MUST be added to `tools/codex-parity-check.sh` (the coverage guard `tools/tools_test_coverage_guard.py` fails CI otherwise); conventional commits, feature branch off `main`, never `git add -A`.

## Status block

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **Accepted on merge of PR #1393, with the review record in §7 items 4–8** — exit gate = five out-of-family `just codex-review` rounds on the PR (40 P1 / 22 P2 in total, every finding absorbed in-plan before the next round; one spec-internal tension registered, not absorbed); item 8 is the terminal record and states the residual classes honestly (yield did NOT converge to zero — it is carried by unit execution's RED-first + per-PR codex + merge-gate). The spec's clearance marker (same PR) admits the plan only under this recorded gate. |
| Version | v1.0 + **rev 2026-08-19 (spec v1.3 X3 absorption, U-HE-14 only)**: the U-HE-14 audit template's family table is re-headed "Derived families + new-fact carriers" with a `Relation` column (`derived` / `part of store N` / `sole carrier (new fact)`) and the `.seq` allocator, transition-marker `fresh_lease`, and LEASE sidecars are classified per the as-landed audit — the S4 units (U-HE-17/22/23/30) land against that classification, not the v1.0 "no new authority" template. No other unit changed. + **rev 2026-08-19 (S4a execution correction, U-HE-15 Step 4b only)**: no-upstream teardown residue clause replaced by spec-exact `@{u}..HEAD` scope with the no-upstream composition registered as a residual (rationale at Step 4b). |
| Date | 2026-08-18 |
| Repo | `17011f89c` (every `file:line` below is pinned there, matching the spec's `[V]` set; re-verified in this authoring session) |
| Path | `.harness/plan/Implementation_Plan_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1.md` |
| Skill | `writing-plans` (structure) + `implementation-planner` (atomic-decomposition discipline §2–§7) |
| Source-set | `Spec_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1.md` (35 contracts, §5 files table, §6 build order, §8.1 manifest, §11 open items); `.harness/adr/ADR-HE-1..4` (context only — the spec is the canonical input) |
| Entry authorization | `/context-restore` → operator: "the specification … is complete. Now we move to the next phase to /writing-plans" |
| Exit gate | Plan review = lean protocol on the doc-only PR: `just codex-review` rounds, absorbed round by round (§7 items 4–8 are the durable record; item 8 states the terminal verdict + residual classes). No separate marker for the plan (H_E tooling; spec §14's marker is for the spec, and it names this gate) |

## Shape decision (front-matter)

**Milestone-led**, mirroring spec §6's unified build order S1–S8 exactly. Grounding: §6 is declared as "the **single order the plan decomposes from**", carries two gate columns (lane safety / measurement) and a dependency DAG. Units are numbered `U-HE-NN` in topological order; each S-step is one plan section. Two plan-level refinements of §6, both stated here so they are reviewable and neither changes a contract:

1. **`U-HE-01` (finding record) precedes the S1 wrapper units.** §6 places S1 and S2 as parallel roots. C-HE-18 §3 requires the codex wrapper to emit a finding row *on the C-HE-24 record*, so the record schema is the true foundational unit. Ordering S2's record ahead of S1's wrapper satisfies both roots' dependencies without violating either.
2. **`U-HE-29` (`loop_status.md` venue + row shape + `NOTIFY` kind, S4d) precedes S4b/S4c.** C-HE-03 §5, C-HE-06 §4/§10 and C-HE-11 §5 all *emit `NOTIFY` rows*, whose kind and structured column are defined only in C-HE-09 §3/§5. §6 lists S4d parallel to S4b; the plan serialises the venue/row-shape unit first so the emitters have a target. Coalescing (C-HE-10) and env isolation (C-HE-11) stay where §6 puts them.

## §1 Plan summary

45 atomic units realise all 35 contracts. Foundational anchors: `U-HE-01` finding record (C-HE-24), `U-HE-05` verification manifest scaffold (§8.1), `U-HE-17` reservation record (C-HE-03), `U-HE-22` merge-door lease primitive (C-HE-06), `U-HE-29` loop-status venue (C-HE-09). Every unit cites its contract by ID **and section**; the coverage matrix (§4) shows every contract row marked and every unit column marked. New files created: `tools/{finding_record,reservations,merge_door,review_wrapper_common,codex_review,arc_disjoint_check,reviewer_concurrency_probe,shadow_trial,lanes_verify,main_protection}.py`, `tools/mechanized_checks/`, `tools/review_schemas/*.schema.json`, `tools/hooks/{safe-merge.sh,lane-init.sh}`, `.harness/spec/store-audit-he-loop-lanes.md`, `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`, `.harness/mechanized-checks-state.json`, and their tests. Every path is exact (this workspace's execution posture resolves nothing lazily).

**Honest aggregate (spec §6).** Phase 0 = S1–S4 = `U-HE-01`…`U-HE-33`, roughly double v1's Phase 0. It is unconditional; nothing in it is deferrable.

### Conventions used in every unit below

- **Files** lists exact paths; `Modify:` carries the pinned line range at `17011f89c`.
- **Steps** are the TDD cycle: write the failing test → run it RED → implement → run it GREEN → (mutation-probe where the spec marks one) → register in `tools/codex-parity-check.sh` and the §8.1 manifest → commit. Commands are exact; expected output is stated.
- **Manifest registration** means appending a `Row(...)` to `MANIFEST` in `tools/lanes_verify.py` (`U-HE-05`).
- **mutation-probe** invocations use the tool that exists at HEAD: `just mutation-probe --file <F> --lines <A-B> --test "<cmd>"` (`justfile:259-260`, `tools/mutation_probe.py`). The `--lines` range is the guard being reverted; the plan names the guard, the executor reads the exact line numbers from the file they just wrote. **Order (Codex round-5 P1):** the tool REFUSES an untracked or dirty target, so every unit's cycle is: write tests + code → GREEN → **commit** (`feat:`/`test:`) → run the probes → commit the probe log + manifest registration (`test(he-lanes): U-HE-NN probes pinned + manifest rows`). Where a unit's steps below list "probe" before "commit", read them in this order.
- Python style: stdlib + `jsonschema`; `from __future__ import annotations`; dataclasses; no third-party retry/lock libraries; `ruff` clean.
- **Never `git add -A`.** Stage the exact paths each commit step names.

## §2 Atomic units

# S2 (foundational half) — the finding record everything emits into

### U-HE-01: Finding record — 8-field core + envelope + schema + reducer + `Finding` projection

**Scope.** Create `tools/finding_record.py`: the ratified 8-field finding core, the row envelope, a JSON schema (`additionalProperties: false`), write-time checks (`disposition_actor ≠ producer`, `:`-free identifiers, `record_kind` union), append-only emission into `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`, the `finding_id` reducer (last row wins), and the projection to `codex_context_guard.Finding`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-24 §1 (core), §2 (envelope + `record_kind` union + `disposition_actor`), §3 (projection + `code` triple), §4 (`finding_id`), §5 (append-only adjudication), §6 (`lane_id`/`arc_id` on every row); C-HE-23 §1 (JSONL stays the format), §3 (no hash chain); C-HE-16 §3 (`fail_class` vocabulary carried in `finding_type`).

**Files.**
- Create: `tools/finding_record.py`
- Create: `tools/review_schemas/finding_record.schema.json`
- Create: `tools/test_finding_record.py`
- Modify: `tools/codex-parity-check.sh:13-36` (add the test file)

**Interfaces.**
- Consumes: `codex_context_guard.Finding` (`tools/codex_context_guard.py:113-117`, frozen dataclass `severity, code, message`).
- Produces (later units rely on these exact names):
  ```python
  RECORD_KINDS = ("finding", "finding_adjudication", "no_finding", "equivalence_proof", "gate_demotion", "reviewer_unavailable")
  DISPOSITIONS = (None, "accepted", "rejected", "suppressed")
  SEVERITIES = ("P1", "P2", "P3", "hard", "warn", "info")
  GATE_LOG_JSONL = REPO / ".harness" / "merge-gate-log.jsonl"
  class RecordError(ValueError)
  @dataclass(frozen=True) class FindingCore(finding_id, location, observed_evidence, expected_contract, severity, finding_type, lineage_claim, producer)
  @dataclass(frozen=True) class Envelope(record_kind, ts, arc_id, lane_id, head_sha, base_sha, diff_digest, round_n, cause_attribution=None, disposition=None, disposition_actor=None, unique_catch=None)
  def make_finding_id(producer: str, head_sha: str, location: str, n: int) -> str
  def make_row(core: FindingCore, env: Envelope) -> dict
  def validate(row: dict) -> None                       # raises RecordError
  def append_row(row: dict, path: Path = GATE_LOG_JSONL) -> None
  def read_rows(path: Path = GATE_LOG_JSONL) -> list[dict]
  def reduce_last_by_finding_id(rows: list[dict]) -> dict[str, dict]
  def to_guard_finding(row: dict) -> Finding
  def now_iso() -> str
  ```

**Depends on.** (none) — foundational.

**Reading of the spec applied here (stated, not invented).** C-HE-24 §3 derives projection `severity` "from `finding_type`/fail-class" and `code` = `<check>:<fail_class>:<cause_attribution>`; C-HE-16 §3 says every C-HE-24 row a reviewer failure produces carries `fail_class`. The plan therefore carries the fail-class vocabulary **in `finding_type`** (values such as `transient-retry`, `permanent-fail-exit`, `HITL-recoverable`, `terminal-…`, `Reflexion-…`, `equivalence_proof`) and `check` = `producer`. `severity` accepts the reviewer triple `P1|P2|P3` (C-HE-15 §4) **and** the projection triple `hard|warn|info` (C-HE-31 §4(c) writes `severity=warn` on `gate_demotion` rows). If the reviewer prefers a single vocabulary, that is a v1.1 spec note, not a plan change.

"""C-HE-24 common finding record and its `Finding` projection.

Every finding-class row (reviewer verdicts, deterministic checks, adjudications,

8-field core plus the row envelope and is appended to
``.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`` (C-HE-23 §2). ``.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl``
carries only ``record_kind=arc`` rows and never uses this module's emitter.

Adjudication is append-only (C-HE-24 §5): a later disposition is a new
``finding_adjudication`` row with the same ``finding_id``; readers reduce to
the last row. The write-time checks below are the enforcement of the "reviewer
is never authoritative for disposition" rule -- not prose.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run to verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tools/test_finding_record.py -q`
Expected: `12 passed`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit the code first (the probe tool refuses untracked/dirty targets)**

```bash
git add tools/finding_record.py tools/review_schemas/finding_record.schema.json tools/test_finding_record.py
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-01 finding record — 8-field core + envelope + projection (C-HE-24)"
```

- [ ] **Step 6b: Mutation probes (spec-marked)**

Run each; expected `PROBE PINNED` (exit 0):
- `just mutation-probe --file tools/finding_record.py --lines <the disposition_actor==producer raise block> --test "uv run pytest tools/test_finding_record.py::test_self_disposition_rejected_at_write -q"`
- `just mutation-probe --file tools/finding_record.py --lines <the _check_adjudication_against_original call in append_row> --test "uv run pytest tools/test_finding_record.py::test_adjudication_cannot_change_core_or_evade_self_disposition -q"`
- `just mutation-probe --file tools/finding_record.py --lines <the ':' charset loop> --test "uv run pytest tools/test_finding_record.py::test_colon_in_identifier_rejected -q"`

- [ ] **Step 7: Register + commit the evidence**

Add `tools/test_finding_record.py \` to the list in `tools/codex-parity-check.sh` (after `tools/test_arc_metrics.py \`). Run `bash tools/codex-parity-check.sh` → all green.

```bash
git add tools/codex-parity-check.sh .harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl
git commit -m "test(he-lanes): U-HE-01 probes pinned + parity registration"
```

**Acceptance (functional).** All Step-1 tests green; both mutation probes pinned; `python tools/finding_record.py validate` exits 0 on an empty/absent file. **Manifest rows (added in U-HE-05):** `tools/test_finding_record.py` → tag `phase0`, mutation-probe `yes`.

# S1 — Verdict validity, terminal states, failover, wrapper (live at N=1)

### U-HE-02: Review wrapper common module — terminal states, classifier table, schema parse, binding byte-compare, retry loop

**Scope.** Create `tools/review_wrapper_common.py`: the shared fail-closed core every reviewer channel wrapper uses — `{APPROVE, BLOCK, REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE}` terminal states, the per-CLI transient/permanent classifier table (module-level, unit-tested row by row), fenced-JSON extraction + JSON-Schema parse, independent computation and byte-compare of the six binding fields, the `550 s × 2 / 1260 s` retry loop with the dynamic second timeout, and the outcome→finding-row emitter.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-15 §1 (parse-to-schema counts; exit code never a signal), §2 (missing/empty/truncated/malformed → `REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE`), §3 (six binding fields; no reuse across `head_sha`), §4 (schema files, fenced block, out-of-enum severity → unavailable, wrapper computes expected binding and byte-compares); C-HE-16 §1–§4 (classification, permanent skips retry, terminal-state triple, retry parameters, table in code); C-HE-21 §2 (#5 invariant live-carried).

**Files.**
- Create: `tools/review_wrapper_common.py`
- Create: `tools/test_review_wrapper.py`
- Modify: `tools/codex-parity-check.sh` (add the test)

**Interfaces.**
- Consumes: `agy_review.run_bounded`, `agy_review.TOTAL_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (`tools/agy_review.py:22, 99-183`); `finding_record` (U-HE-01).
- Produces:
  ```python
  TERMINAL_STATES = ("APPROVE", "BLOCK", "REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE")
  BINDING_FIELDS = ("head_sha", "base_sha", "diff_digest", "reviewer_identity", "prompt_version", "config_hash")
  PER_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_S = 550.0; MAX_ATTEMPTS = 2; TOTAL_BUDGET_S = 1260.0; SECOND_ATTEMPT_MARGIN_S = 30.0
  CLASSIFIER: tuple[tuple[str, re.Pattern[str], str], ...]
  @dataclass class Attempt(stdout: str, stderr: str, returncode: int | None, timed_out: bool)
  @dataclass class ReviewOutcome(terminal, channel, failure_class, reason, findings, binding, source)
  def classify(channel: str, text: str) -> str            # "permanent" | "transient"
  def compute_binding(repo: Path, base: str, *, channel: str, prompt_version: str, config_hash: str) -> dict[str, str]
  def load_schema(channel: str) -> dict
  def extract_fenced_json(text: str) -> str | None
  def parse_verdict(channel: str, text: str, expected: dict[str, str], *, source: str = "stdout") -> ReviewOutcome
  def run_with_retry(invoke, *, channel, expected, deadline, clock=time.monotonic) -> ReviewOutcome
  def run_with_failover(primary, failover) -> tuple[ReviewOutcome, ReviewOutcome | None]
  def outcome_rows(outcome, *, producer, arc_id, lane_id, round_n) -> list[dict]
  def exit_code(outcome: ReviewOutcome) -> int              # APPROVE 0 / BLOCK 1 / REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE 2
  def env_arc_and_lane() -> tuple[str, str]
  ```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tools/test_review_wrapper.py -q` → all pass (26 tests incl. parametrizations).

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutation probe (spec-marked, C-HE-15 verification)**

`just mutation-probe --file tools/review_wrapper_common.py --lines <the `if not text or not text.strip(): return unavailable("empty output")` lines> --test "uv run pytest tools/test_review_wrapper.py::test_empty_stdout_exit0_is_unavailable -q"` → PINNED. (Removing the guard makes the empty string fall to "no fenced json block", still unavailable — so ALSO probe the `no fenced json block` return: the test must go red only when *both* are removed; the spec's target is "revert to exit-code keying → empty output reads APPROVE". Implement the probe by pointing `--lines` at the whole `parse_verdict` unavailable-path block through the fenced-block check; the executor records which range went RED.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Register + commit**

```bash
git add tools/review_wrapper_common.py tools/test_review_wrapper.py tools/codex-parity-check.sh
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-02 fail-closed review wrapper core — schema parse, classifier, retry (C-HE-15/16)"
```

**Acceptance (functional).** Battery green; classifier table has ≥ 1 test per row; `python -c "import review_wrapper_common as rw; assert rw.classify('codex','???')=='transient'"`. **Manifest rows (U-HE-05):** `tools/test_review_wrapper.py` phase0, mutation-probe yes; `::test_failover_*` phase0.

---

### U-HE-03: Review verdict schemas for `codex`, `gemini`, `merge-gate`

**Scope.** Declare each mandatory channel's output schema as a JSON-Schema file: `verdict ∈ {APPROVE, BLOCK}`, `findings[]` items `{severity ∈ {P1,P2,P3}, location, message}` with `additionalProperties: false`, and all six binding fields required.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-15 §4; C-HE-17 §4 (gemini must carry the same schema-shape rule); C-HE-24 §3 (this severity triple is distinct from the guard's `hard/warn/info`).

**Files.** Create `tools/review_schemas/codex.schema.json`, `tools/review_schemas/gemini.schema.json`, `tools/review_schemas/merge-gate.schema.json`. Test lives in U-HE-02 (`test_schema_requires_all_six_binding_fields`) plus one extra:

- [ ] **Step 1: Add to `tools/test_review_wrapper.py`**

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("channel", ["codex", "gemini", "merge-gate"])
def test_channel_schema_shape(channel):
    s = rw.load_schema(channel)
    assert s["additionalProperties"] is False
    assert s["properties"]["verdict"]["enum"] == ["APPROVE", "BLOCK"]
    item = s["properties"]["findings"]["items"]
    assert item["additionalProperties"] is False
    assert item["properties"]["severity"]["enum"] == ["P1", "P2", "P3"]
    assert set(rw.BINDING_FIELDS) <= set(s["required"])
```

- [ ] **Step 2: RED** — `FileNotFoundError` for the schema files.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the three files** — identical body except `reviewer_identity`:

`tools/review_schemas/codex.schema.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "codex-review verdict (C-HE-15 §4)",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["verdict", "findings", "head_sha", "base_sha", "diff_digest", "reviewer_identity", "prompt_version", "config_hash"],
  "properties": {

        "type": "object",
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["severity", "location", "message"],
        "properties": {
          "severity": {"enum": ["P1", "P2", "P3"]},
          "location": {"type": "string"},
          "message": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    },
    "head_sha": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{40}$"},
    "base_sha": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{40}$"},
    "diff_digest": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{64}$"},
    "reviewer_identity": {"const": "codex-review"},
    "prompt_version": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
    "config_hash": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1}
  }
}
```
`gemini.schema.json`: same, `"reviewer_identity": {"const": "gemini-review"}`, title `gemini-review verdict`.
`merge-gate.schema.json`: same, `"reviewer_identity": {"pattern": "^merge-gate-[a-z-]+$"}` (one per lens), title `merge-gate lens verdict`.

- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN** — `uv run pytest tools/test_review_wrapper.py -q -k schema`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add tools/review_schemas/codex.schema.json tools/review_schemas/gemini.schema.json tools/review_schemas/merge-gate.schema.json tools/test_review_wrapper.py
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-03 declared verdict schemas per channel (C-HE-15 §4)"
```

**Acceptance.** Three files exist; shape test green. (The test file for U-HE-02 depends on these; in practice land U-HE-03's files inside U-HE-02's commit if executing serially — coherent rollback is preserved either way.)

---

### U-HE-04: `tools/codex_review.py` fail-closed wrapper + session-artifact discovery + `just codex-review` reroute

**Scope.** Create the codex channel wrapper: bounded `codex review --base <base> "<instructions>"` invocation with exit-code-independent capture, prompt that requires the fenced JSON block with the six binding values, `run_with_retry`, session-artifact discovery when stdout is inconclusive (newest file under `~/.codex/sessions/` modified after the wrapper's start containing the invocation's `head_sha`, ≤ 130 s after exit), positive parse from whichever source, finding rows on silent death, and rerouting `just codex-review` through it.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-18 §1 (mirror `agy_review` hardening; `just codex-review` routes through it), §2 (session artifact discovery, 130 s), §3 (zero-byte/auth-only → finding row `producer=codex_review_wrapper`); C-HE-15 §4 (fenced block required by the channel prompt); C-HE-16 §3 (retry); C-HE-24 (rows).

**Files.**
- Create: `tools/codex_review.py`
- Modify: `tools/test_review_wrapper.py` (add the artifact fixture + wrapper tests)
- Modify: `justfile:593-595` (`codex-review` recipe body → `uv run python tools/codex_review.py --base {{base}}`)

**Interfaces.**
- Consumes: `review_wrapper_common` (U-HE-02), `agy_review.run_bounded` (`tools/agy_review.py:99`).
- Produces:
  ```python
  SESSIONS_DIR = Path.home() / ".codex" / "sessions"
  ARTIFACT_LAG_S = 130.0
  PROMPT_VERSION = "codex-review-v1"
  def review_instructions(binding: dict[str, str]) -> str
  def build_command(base: str, instructions: str) -> list[str]
  def find_session_artifact(head_sha: str, *, started_at: float, now: float, root: Path = SESSIONS_DIR) -> Path | None
  def run_codex_review(repo: Path, base: str, *, invoke=None, clock=time.monotonic) -> ReviewOutcome
  def main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int
  ```

**Depends on.** U-HE-02, U-HE-03, U-HE-01.

**Interface probe (done at planning time, re-run at execution):** `codex review --help` shows `Usage: codex review [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]` — "Custom review instructions" — so the instructions ride as the positional argument. Session artifacts live at `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl` (verified 2026-08-18).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing tests to `tools/test_review_wrapper.py`**

```python
import time
from pathlib import Path

import codex_review as cr


def _artifact_tree(tmp_path: Path, head: str, mtime: float) -> Path:
    d = tmp_path / "2026" / "08" / "18"

    p = d / "rollout-2026-08-18T00-00-00-abc.jsonl"
    # real shape: the assistant text (fenced block, newlines ESCAPED inside the string) nested in a JSONL envelope
    p.write_text(json.dumps({"type": "response_item", "payload": {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "output_text", "text": _block(head_sha=head)}]}}) + "\n")
    import os

    return p


def test_artifact_text_decodes_jsonl_envelopes(tmp_path):
    p = _artifact_tree(tmp_path, "a" * 40, mtime=1.0)
    raw = p.read_text(); decoded = cr.artifact_text(p)

```make
# Out-of-family review of the current branch vs BASE (default main), subscription auth.
# Routed through the fail-closed wrapper (C-HE-18): schema-parsed verdict, session-artifact
# fallback, REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE on any parse failure. Exit 0 APPROVE / 1 BLOCK / 2 UNAVAILABLE.
codex-review base='main': _require-codex-subscription
    uv run python tools/codex_review.py --base {{base}}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: GREEN** — `uv run pytest tools/test_review_wrapper.py -q`; then a live smoke: `just codex-review` on a trivial branch prints a terminal state and exits 0/1/2 (never silently 0 on empty).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**
```bash
git add tools/codex_review.py tools/test_review_wrapper.py justfile
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-04 codex_review.py fail-closed wrapper + session-artifact fallback; just codex-review routes through it (C-HE-18)"
```

**Acceptance.** Battery + artifact fixture green; `just codex-review` on a real diff yields a parsed verdict or `REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE` with a `reviewer_unavailable` row in `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`. **Manifest:** part of `tools/test_review_wrapper.py` (phase0).

---
### U-HE-05: Verification manifest scaffold — `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `just lanes-verify` / `lanes-phase0-check` / `mutation-probe-coverage-check`

**Scope.** Create the umbrella runner that owns spec §8.1's manifest as data: one `Row` per test artifact with `contract`, `tag`, `runs_in`, `mutation_probe`, allowed skip reasons; `lanes-verify` runs every row; `lanes-phase0-check` runs `phase0` rows and treats any skip as failure; `mutation-probe-coverage-check` asserts every `mutation_probe=True` row has a PINNED probe result logged. Later units append their rows here.

**Spec linkage.** §8.1 (manifest, skip policy, `phase0` meta row), §0.3 (probe RED-first), C-HE-13 §1 (mechanical pilot gate consumes `lanes-phase0-check`), C-HE-30 (`tools/test_store_audit.py` is a phase0 row).

**Files.**
- Create: `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/test_lanes_verify.py`
- Modify: `tools/mutation_probe.py` (append a result line to `.harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl` on every exit — a run log, derived; listed in the U-HE-14 store audit as a derived family)
- Modify: `justfile` (three recipes after `mutation-probe`)
- Modify: `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`

**Interfaces.**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Row: contract: str; artifact: str; tag: str; runs_in: str; mutation_probe: bool; skip_reasons: tuple[str, ...] = (); depends: str = ""
TAGS = ("phase0", "phase1", "measurement", "layer2", "env", "operator-gated")

def phase0_rows() -> list[Row]
def coverage_gaps(log_path: Path = PROBE_LOG) -> list[Row]
def main(argv) -> int   # subcommands: verify | phase0 | coverage
```
Artifact grammar: `pytest:<nodeid>` → `uv run pytest -q -rs <nodeid>`; `shell:<path>` → `bash <path>`; `just:<recipe>` → `just <recipe>`; `live:<desc>` → not runnable here (operator-gated), reported as such and never counted as pass.

**Depends on.** (none) for the runner; rows reference tests from other units.

- [ ] **Step 4: Log probe results** — in `tools/mutation_probe.py` `main()`, at the single exit point, append:

```python
    log = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / ".harness" / "mutation-probe-log.jsonl"
    log.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    with log.open("a") as fh:
        fh.write(json.dumps({"ts": datetime.now(UTC).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"), "file": str(args.file),
                             "lines": args.lines, "test": args.test, "rc": rc}, sort_keys=True) + "\n")
```
(`rc` = the exit code about to be returned; add `import json` / `from datetime import UTC, datetime` if absent.) Add `.harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl` to git (tracked run log) with an initial empty file.

- [ ] **Step 5: Recipes** — after `mutation-probe` in `justfile`:

```make
# ─── §8.1 verification manifest (spec-he-loop-lanes) ─────────────────────────
lanes-verify:
    uv run python tools/lanes_verify.py verify

# Phase-0 gate: every phase0 row must PASS at HEAD; a skip counts as NOT passed.
lanes-phase0-check:
    uv run python tools/lanes_verify.py phase0

# Every manifest row marked mutation-probe must have a PINNED result logged.
mutation-probe-coverage-check:
    uv run python tools/lanes_verify.py coverage
```

- [ ] **Step 6: GREEN** — `uv run pytest tools/test_lanes_verify.py -q`; `just lanes-verify` runs the seeded rows green.

- [ ] **Step 7: Register + commit**
```bash
git add tools/lanes_verify.py tools/test_lanes_verify.py tools/mutation_probe.py .harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl justfile tools/codex-parity-check.sh
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-05 §8.1 verification manifest runner + phase0 gate + probe coverage check"
```

**Acceptance.** `just lanes-phase0-check` exits 1 when any phase0 row skips (unit-pinned); `just mutation-probe-coverage-check` lists unprobed rows. Coherent rollback: one module + recipes.

### U-HE-06: `agy_review.py` adopts the common module — schema-parsed final verdict, classifier, per-segment retry

**Scope.** Make the gemini channel satisfy C-HE-15/16 through the shared module: the final output (single-segment or synthesis) MUST also carry a fenced JSON block matching `gemini.schema.json` with the six binding values (parsed by `rw.parse_verdict`; the existing marker/`VERDICT:` protocol stays as agy's internal truncation guard); process failures classify via `rw.classify("gemini", …)`; each segment invocation gets one bounded transient re-invocation with the dynamic second timeout; outcomes emit C-HE-24 rows with `producer=gemini_review_wrapper`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-17 §4 (hardened reference; silent-death modes covered by the same schema parse), C-HE-16 §3–§4, C-HE-15 §3–§4, C-HE-18 §3 (rows).

**Files.** Modify `tools/agy_review.py` (`review_prompt` `:274-364`, `synthesis_prompt` `:367-390`, `report_process_failure` `:449-458`, `run_review` `:466-607`, `main` `:610-620`); modify `tools/test_agy_review.py` (fixture helper).

**Depends on.** U-HE-02, U-HE-03.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests** — add to `tools/test_agy_review.py`:

```python
import review_wrapper_common as rw

def _final_output(verdict: str, binding: dict) -> str:
    body = {"verdict": verdict, "findings": [], **binding}
    return "```json\n" + json.dumps(body) + "\n```\nARTIFACT: COMPLETE\nVERDICT: " + verdict


def test_final_output_without_fenced_json_is_unavailable(tmp_path, monkeypatch, fake_agy):
    """Marker + VERDICT line alone no longer counts (C-HE-15 §1)."""
    fake_agy(stdout="ARTIFACT: COMPLETE\nVERDICT: APPROVE")
    assert agy_review.run_review(tmp_path, "main") == 2


def test_final_output_with_schema_block_and_binding_counts(tmp_path, monkeypatch, fake_agy):
    b = agy_review.gemini_binding(tmp_path, "main")
    fake_agy(stdout=_final_output("APPROVE", b))
    assert agy_review.run_review(tmp_path, "main") == 0


def test_permanent_stderr_text_classifies_permanent(capsys):
    proc = subprocess.CompletedProcess([], 1, "", "antigravity CLI not logged in")
    assert agy_review.report_process_failure(proc) == 2
    assert "permanent" in capsys.readouterr().err


def test_transient_segment_failure_gets_one_bounded_retry(tmp_path, monkeypatch, fake_agy_sequence):
    """First segment call returns empty (transient) → exactly one re-invocation with min(550, remaining-30)."""
    seen = fake_agy_sequence(["", _final_output("APPROVE", agy_review.gemini_binding(tmp_path, "main"))])
    assert agy_review.run_review(tmp_path, "main") == 0
    assert len(seen) == 2 and seen[1].timeout <= rw.PER_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_S
```
(`fake_agy` / `fake_agy_sequence` are the file's existing `run_bounded` monkeypatch fixtures — extend `fake_agy_sequence` to record the `timeout=` kwarg per call.) Every existing fixture that returns a final `…COMPLETE\nVERDICT: X` string is updated to `_final_output(X, binding)` in the same sweep (mechanical; ~40 sites; `rg 'VERDICT: (APPROVE|BLOCK)"' tools/test_agy_review.py` enumerates them).

- [ ] **Step 2: RED** — the four new tests fail (`gemini_binding` missing; JSON-less output still returns 0).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Add near the top of `agy_review.py` (after constants):
```python
import review_wrapper_common as rw   # C-HE-15/16 shared core
import finding_record as fr

GEMINI_PROMPT_VERSION = "gemini-review-v2-json"
PRODUCER = "gemini_review_wrapper"


def gemini_binding(repo: Path, base: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    cfg_hash = hashlib.sha256(f"{MODEL_ARGUMENT}|{MAX_AGY_PRINT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}".encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
    return rw.compute_binding(repo, base, channel="gemini", prompt_version=GEMINI_PROMPT_VERSION, config_hash=cfg_hash)


def json_block_instruction(binding: dict[str, str]) -> str:
    return (
        " Immediately BEFORE the completion marker, print ONE fenced ```json block with exactly these "
        "keys: verdict (APPROVE|BLOCK), findings (array of {severity: P1|P2|P3, location, message}), and "
        "these six values copied VERBATIM: " + ", ".join(f"{k}={binding[k]}" for k in rw.BINDING_FIELDS)
        + ". No other keys."
    )
```
- `review_prompt(...)` and `synthesis_prompt(...)` gain a keyword `binding: dict[str, str]` and append `json_block_instruction(binding)` before the completion-marker sentence (single-segment) / before "After every numbered result was read completely" (synthesis). Segment prompts (segment_index set) do NOT require the block — only the artifact-complete output does.
- `report_process_failure`: after computing `detail`, add
```python
    cls = rw.classify("gemini", (proc.stdout or "") + "\n" + detail)
    print(f"agy-review: reviewer unavailable ({cls}): {detail}", file=sys.stderr)
    return 2
```
replacing the two-branch print (exit 2 for both; the classification is what changed).
- In `run_review`, compute `binding = gemini_binding(repo, base)` once after `collect_diff`; pass it into the two prompt builders. Wrap each `run_bounded(...)` call in the per-spec loop and the synthesis call with:
```python
def _bounded_with_retry(cmd_for, deadline, *, cwd, env, marker):
    """C-HE-16 §3: one bounded re-invocation on a transient failure; timeout 2 = min(550, remaining-30)."""
    last = None
    for n in (1, 2):
        remaining = deadline - time.monotonic()
        timeout = min(rw.PER_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_S, remaining - (0 if n == 1 else rw.SECOND_ATTEMPT_MARGIN_S))
        if timeout <= PARENT_TIMEOUT_GRACE_SECONDS:
            return None
        proc = run_bounded(cmd_for(timeout), cwd=cwd, timeout=timeout, env=env)
        ok, _ = validate_review_output(proc.stdout.strip(), marker)
        if proc.returncode == 0 and ok is None:
            return proc
        if rw.classify("gemini", (proc.stdout or "") + "\n" + (proc.stderr or "")) == "permanent":
            return proc
        last = proc
    return last
```
and, at the final-verdict site (both the synthesis branch and the single-segment `else:` branch), replace the `verdict == "VERDICT: BLOCK"` decision with:
```python
    outcome = rw.parse_verdict("gemini", output, binding)
    if outcome.terminal == "REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE":
        print(f"agy-review: reviewer unavailable: {outcome.reason}", file=sys.stderr)
        _emit(outcome); return 2
    if "VERDICT: BLOCK" in accepted_verdicts and outcome.terminal != "BLOCK":
        print("agy-review: synthesis contradicted a blocking segment verdict", file=sys.stderr); return 2
    _emit(outcome)
    print(f"agy-review: effective model: {EXPECTED_MODEL_LABEL}"); print(output)
    if outcome.terminal == "BLOCK":
        print("agy-review: blocking findings require resolution", file=sys.stderr); return 1
    return 0
```
with `_emit(outcome)` = `for row in rw.outcome_rows(outcome, producer=PRODUCER, arc_id=a, lane_id=l, round_n=n): fr.append_row(row)` followed by `rw.record_round_outcome_if_reserved(a, n, channel="gemini", terminal=outcome.terminal, finding_count=len(outcome.findings))`, where `a, l = rw.env_arc_and_lane()` and `n = int(os.environ.get("HARNESS_ROUND_N","0"))` (C-HE-25 per-round outcome; Codex round-1 P1).

- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN** — `uv run pytest tools/test_agy_review.py tools/test_review_wrapper.py -q`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add tools/agy_review.py tools/test_agy_review.py
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-06 gemini channel adopts the fail-closed core — schema block, classifier, bounded retry (C-HE-17 §4)"
```

**Acceptance.** `just gemini-review` on a diff whose output lacks the JSON block exits 2 with `reviewer unavailable`; a compliant output exits 0/1; `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` gains `producer=gemini_review_wrapper` rows.

---

### U-HE-07: Failover chain — `just review-with-failover`, skill carriers, invariant #3 restatement

**Scope.** Wire D-C: on `codex-review` → `REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE`, invoke `just gemini-review` once under the identical bar; its verdict blocks; both rows recorded. Add the recipe, make `ship-pr` and `roadmap-continue` call it as the review step, and restate invariant #3 in those carriers.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-17 §1–§5; C-HE-16 inv (permanent never retries same channel; triggers failover); C-HE-21 §2 (live-carrier rule).

**Files.**
- Modify: `tools/codex_review.py` (add `--failover`), `tools/test_review_wrapper.py` (one integration test)
- Modify: `justfile` (recipe after `gemini-review`)
- Modify: `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md` (review step), `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md` (review step + #3 restatement)

**Depends on.** U-HE-04, U-HE-06.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test** (in `tools/test_review_wrapper.py`):
```python
def test_codex_review_failover_flag_runs_gemini_once_and_blocks(monkeypatch, tmp_path):
    calls = []
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr, "run_codex_review", lambda repo, base, **kw: rw.ReviewOutcome("REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE", "codex", "permanent", "not logged in"))
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr, "_run_gemini_failover", lambda repo, base: (calls.append(1) or rw.ReviewOutcome("BLOCK", "gemini", None, "", [{"severity": "P1", "location": "l", "message": "m"}], EXPECTED, "stdout")))
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr.fr, "GATE_LOG_JSONL", tmp_path / "g.jsonl")
    assert cr.main(["--base", "main", "--failover"]) == 1
    assert calls == [1]
    kinds = [r["record_kind"] for r in cr.fr.read_rows(tmp_path / "g.jsonl")]
    assert kinds == ["reviewer_unavailable"]                 # primary's row only; the gemini subprocess is the sole emitter of its own rows


def test_failover_preflight_failure_still_records_both_reasons(monkeypatch, tmp_path):
    """`just gemini-review` dies at `_require-antigravity` → the subprocess wrote nothing → the failover path emits."""
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr.fr, "GATE_LOG_JSONL", tmp_path / "g.jsonl")
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr.subprocess, "run", lambda *a, **k: subprocess.CompletedProcess(a[0], 1, "", "ERROR: agy (Antigravity CLI) not found on PATH."))
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr.rw, "compute_binding", lambda *a, **k: dict(EXPECTED))
    monkeypatch.setattr(cr, "_gemini_config_hash", lambda: "x")
    out = cr._run_gemini_failover(Path("."), "main")
    assert out.terminal == "REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE" and out.failure_class == "permanent"
    rows = cr.fr.read_rows(tmp_path / "g.jsonl")
    assert len(rows) == 1 and rows[0]["producer"] == "gemini_review_wrapper" and rows[0]["record_kind"] == "reviewer_unavailable"
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED** — `--failover` unrecognised.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement** in `tools/codex_review.py`:
```python
def _run_gemini_failover(repo: Path, base: str) -> rw.ReviewOutcome:
    """Identical bar (C-HE-17 §1): the gemini wrapper's own schema parse; exit code read back as terminal."""
    before = sum(1 for r in fr.read_rows() if r["producer"] == "gemini_review_wrapper")
    proc = subprocess.run(["just", "gemini-review", base], cwd=repo, capture_output=True, text=True)
    binding = rw.compute_binding(repo, base, channel="gemini", prompt_version="gemini-review-v2-json", config_hash="failover")
    outcome = rw.parse_verdict("gemini", proc.stdout, {**binding, "config_hash": _gemini_config_hash()})
    if outcome.terminal == "REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE":
        outcome.failure_class = rw.classify("gemini", proc.stdout + "\n" + proc.stderr)
    after = sum(1 for r in fr.read_rows() if r["producer"] == "gemini_review_wrapper")
    if after == before:
        # The recipe died at its `_require-antigravity` preflight (or the wrapper never ran): no row was written by the
        # subprocess, so BOTH reasons would not be on record (C-HE-17). Emit here -- and only here (Codex round-3 P2).
        _emit_rows(outcome, producer="gemini_review_wrapper", channel="gemini")
    return outcome
```
(`_gemini_config_hash()` imports `agy_review.gemini_binding`'s hash rule so the binding matches — factor it as `agy_review.gemini_config_hash()` in U-HE-06 and import it here.) In `main()`: add `p.add_argument("--failover", action="store_true")`; when set:
```python
    primary, fo = rw.run_with_failover(lambda: run_codex_review(Path.cwd(), args.base, invoke=invoke),
                                       lambda: _run_gemini_failover(Path.cwd(), args.base))
    _emit_rows(primary)
    if fo is not None:
        final = fo            # NO second emission: `just gemini-review` (agy_review, U-HE-06) already wrote its rows
    else:                     # and its round outcome (Codex round-2 P2: no duplicated findings in the ledger)
        final = primary
```
and print/return `rw.exit_code(final)` (a failover `REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE` → 2 with both reasons on stderr).
- [ ] **Step 4: Recipe** (justfile, after `gemini-review`):
```make
# D-C failover chain (C-HE-17): codex-review, then gemini-review ONCE on REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE,
# identical bar; the failover verdict blocks. Exit 0/1/2 as codex-review.
# NO `_require-codex-subscription` prerequisite here (Codex round-2 P1): a missing binary / stale login is exactly the
# permanent failure the wrapper classifies (C-HE-16 §4) and that MUST reach the failover (C-HE-17). The wrapper is the
# loud-failure surface: exit 2 + a `reviewer_unavailable` row -- never a silent metered fallback.
review-with-failover base='main':
    uv run python tools/codex_review.py --base {{base}} --failover
```
- [ ] **Step 5: Carriers.** In `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md`, replace the review-step instruction that invokes `just codex-review` with `just review-with-failover` and add this sentence under the review step: *"Invariant #3 (restated, C-HE-17 §3): out-of-family review covers Codex-authored work as before, AND serves as the D-C failover for Claude-authored diffs at the identical bar. Exit 2 (`REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE` on both channels) blocks the arc; record both reasons."*
- [ ] **Step 6: GREEN + commit**
```bash
git add tools/codex_review.py tools/test_review_wrapper.py justfile .claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md .claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-07 D-C failover chain + carriers + invariant #3 restatement (C-HE-17)"
```
**Acceptance.** Integration test green; `rg 'review-with-failover' .claude/skills/{ship-pr,roadmap-continue}/SKILL.md` ≥ 1 each; AC#6 both channels carry gate contracts (schemas from U-HE-03).

### U-HE-08: CI terminal states — `CANCELLED` explicit in `arc_metrics.py` and `ship-pr`

**Scope.** Introduce the exact CI outcome enum `{SUCCESS, FAILURE, CANCELLED}` and a single predicate `ci_is_green(conclusion)`; name `CANCELLED` explicitly as INCOMPLETE in `ship-pr`'s post-merge acceptance logic (the merge door consumes the same predicate in U-HE-23).

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-19 §1–§3; C-HE-06 §4(vii) consumer.

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (new constants near `MERGED_REF` `:79`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md:199-204`.

**Depends on.** (none).

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test** (`tools/test_arc_metrics.py`):
```python
# mutation-probe: add "cancelled" to CI_GREEN in arc_metrics
@pytest.mark.parametrize("conclusion,green", [("success", True), ("failure", False), ("cancelled", False), ("", False), (None, False), ("SUCCESS", True)])
def test_ci_state_cancelled_incomplete(conclusion, green):
    assert am.ci_is_green(conclusion) is green
    assert am.CI_TERMINAL == ("SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "CANCELLED")
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Implement** after `MERGED_REF`:
```python
#: C-HE-19: CI outcomes are exactly these; CANCELLED is INCOMPLETE, never green.
CI_TERMINAL = ("SUCCESS", "FAILURE", "CANCELLED")
CI_GREEN = frozenset({"SUCCESS"})


def ci_is_green(conclusion: str | None) -> bool:
    """Only an exact `success` counts. Named explicitly (not by whitelist omission): CANCELLED -> False."""
    if not conclusion:
        return False
    c = conclusion.upper()
    if c == "CANCELLED":
        return False
    return c in CI_GREEN
```
- [ ] **Step 4:** In `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md:199-204` add the sentence: *"Accepted set is exactly `{success}`; `cancelled` and `failure` are named INCOMPLETE (C-HE-19). Do not infer green from the absence of a failure."*
- [ ] **Step 5: GREEN, probe** `just mutation-probe --file tools/arc_metrics.py --lines <the CANCELLED early-return> --test "uv run pytest tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_ci_state_cancelled_incomplete -q"` → PINNED. **Register manifest row** `Row("C-HE-19/20", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_ci_state_cancelled_incomplete", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** — `git add tools/arc_metrics.py tools/test_arc_metrics.py .claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md tools/lanes_verify.py && git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-08 CI terminal states — CANCELLED is INCOMPLETE (C-HE-19)"`.

---

### U-HE-09: HITL TTL re-surface — 24 h notification, never reclaim

**Scope.** Add `loop_hil_ttl_resurface()` to `loop_lib.sh`: for every pending `DEFERRED-HIL` row older than `HARNESS_HIL_TTL_S` (default 86400), append one `NOTIFY` row naming the item as TTL-expired (once per 24 h window per item). It touches no reservation, lease, or marker.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-20 §1 (existing HITL queue; `NOTIFY` for informational), §2 (TTL is a notification threshold; MUST NOT reclaim/release/transition); C-HE-09 §5 (`NOTIFY` kind — landed by U-HE-29; until then the row is written with the legacy 3-column shape and U-HE-29's reducer treats it as legacy).

**Files.** Modify `tools/hooks/loop_lib.sh` (new function after `loop_pending_hil_summary`), `tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh`, `tools/hooks/session-start.sh` (call it once at start).

**Depends on.** (none). (U-HE-29 later upgrades the row shape.)

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test** (`tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh`, using the file's `loop_now` stub idiom):
```bash
# C-HE-20: TTL re-surfaces, never reclaims

```
(Executor note: the `date` invocation must work on macOS (`-j -f`) and Linux (`-d`); the two-form fallback above is the file's convention for portable date parsing — verify on both with `bash tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh` locally and in CI. The reducer is already shape-aware for the structured column U-HE-29 introduces (`$4 ~ /^lane=/` → detail is `$5`) so it keeps keying on the HIL item token after the venue change; U-HE-29's test file re-runs this block against structured rows.)
- [ ] **Step 4:** In `tools/hooks/session-start.sh`, after the existing pending-HIL summary line, add `loop_hil_ttl_resurface`.
- [ ] **Step 5: GREEN, probe.** `just mutation-probe --file tools/hooks/loop_lib.sh --lines <the "state unchanged" contract: replace loop_log NOTIFY with loop_resolve in a scratch mutation is not a line-removal; instead probe by removing the `(!(t in last) || …)` idempotence clause> --test "bash tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh"` → PINNED. The spec's stated probe ("add a reclaim-on-TTL → red") is a *positive* mutation the tool cannot express; the second assertion (`loop_skip_set` unchanged) is the witness that a reclaim would turn red — record this in the evidence log. **Register** `Row("C-HE-19/20", "shell:tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** — `git add tools/hooks/loop_lib.sh tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh tools/hooks/session-start.sh tools/lanes_verify.py && git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-09 HITL TTL re-surface as NOTIFY, never reclaim (C-HE-20)"`.

# S2 (remainder) — record extension, env overrides, arc_type at open, gate-log sibling

### U-HE-10: `ARC_METRICS_REPO` / `ARC_METRICS_LEDGER` env overrides

**Scope.** `REPO` and `LEDGER` in `arc_metrics.py` become env-overridable, mirroring the existing `ARC_METRICS_QUEUE_DIR` / `ARC_METRICS_MERGED_REF` pattern; production defaults unchanged when unset. This is the prerequisite for every subprocess-based AC#2 probe.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-05 §1–§3 + Invariants; C-HE-04 verification (AC#2(a) needs it).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py:44-45`; `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`.

**Depends on.** (none).

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test**

### U-HE-11: Arc-row field extension + null-safe cohort split

**Scope.** Extend `ArcRow` with the C-HE-25 fields; assert `.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl` carries only `record_kind=arc` rows; make the cohort split tolerate `null` on historical rows and group by `concurrent_lanes_at_open`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-25 (fields; single arc row per `arc_id`; additive-safe reads `:765-775,810-832`); C-HE-24 §2 (arc rows only here); C-HE-28 §1 (cohort key shape).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`ArcRow` `:87-131`, `summary` `:807-915`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-10.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests**
```python
NEW_FIELDS = ["record_kind", "reviewer_identity", "prompt_version", "config_hash", "arc_type_open", "arc_type_close",

```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Implement** — add to `ArcRow` after `notes`:
```python
    # -- C-HE-25 extension (all additive; historical rows read as null) --
    record_kind: str = "arc"
    reviewer_identity: str | None = None

    concurrent_lanes_max: int | None = None
    phases: dict[str, dict] = field(default_factory=dict)  # {phase: {start, end}} (C-HE-27)
```
In `summary()`, after the lever cohorts block, add a second grouping printed as its own section:
```python
    by_lanes: dict[str, list[dict]] = {}
    for r in rows:
        by_lanes.setdefault(f"concurrent_lanes_at_open={r.get('concurrent_lanes_at_open')}", []).append(r)
    for label in sorted(by_lanes):
        print(f"-- LANES [{label}] (n={len(by_lanes[label])}) " + "-" * 20)
```
(`None` renders as `null` via `json.dumps(r.get(...))`; use that instead of `f"{...}"` so the label is `concurrent_lanes_at_open=null`.)
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**; add `am.summary` invocation to the ledger schema test list; register `Row("C-HE-23–26", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_arc_row_schema_has_c_he_25_fields", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `git add tools/arc_metrics.py tools/test_arc_metrics.py tools/lanes_verify.py && git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-11 arc-row field extension + null-safe lane cohort (C-HE-25)"`.

### U-HE-12: `arc_type_open / arc_type_close / arc_type_declared_at` on the single arc row (ledger side of open-time capture)

**Scope.** `queue`/`extract` gain `--arc-type-declared-at {open,close}` and populate `arc_type_open`/`arc_type_close`; a close-time relabel updates the single arc row's `arc_type_close` in place (never a second row). The open-time *capture point* (reservation payload) is U-HE-17/U-HE-21.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-26 §2 (close-time change updates the single row), §1 (open-time capture is the reservation — deferred to S4b by the S2 hand-off contract: S2-GREEN = schema-present only); C-HE-25 (`arc_type_declared_at ∈ {open, close}`).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`extract` `:280-392`, `queue_capture` `:418-501`, `main` `:928-968`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-11.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test**
```python
def test_arc_type_at_open(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Close-time relabel: ONE arc row, arc_type_open != arc_type_close, no duplicate arc_id."""

In `main()`: `ex.add_argument("--arc-type-declared-at", choices=["open", "close"], default="close")`, same on `q`; add subcommand `relabel --arc-id --arc-type-close` → `relabel_arc_type_close`.
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**; register `Row("C-HE-23–26", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_arc_type_at_open", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`.

### U-HE-13: `merge-gate` emits `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` first, markdown second; consistency reducer

**Scope.** The merge-gate skill's log-row emission writes the JSONL row (via `finding_record.append_row`) **before** the markdown row; a failed markdown write logs a `warn` finding and leaves the JSONL row; a failed JSONL write fails the gate step. Add the consistency reducer to `lanes-verify`: every markdown row has a JSONL sibling with the same `(pr, head_sha, verdict)`; a JSONL row with neither a markdown sibling nor a matching `warn` finding is its own orphan class, reconciled by re-emitting markdown on the next gate run.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-23 §2 (sibling; write order; failure semantics; consistency check + orphan class), C-HE-24 §2 (`record_kind` union for this file); C-HE-15 §1 (unrecordable verdict does not count).

**Files.**
- Create: `tools/merge_gate_log.py` (emitter + reducer used by the skill and by `lanes-verify`), `tools/test_merge_gate_log.py`, `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` (tracked, initially empty)
- Modify: `.claude/skills/merge-gate/SKILL.md` (log-row emission step calls `python tools/merge_gate_log.py emit …`), `tools/lanes_verify.py` (`Row("C-HE-23", "just:merge-gate-log-check", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`), `justfile` (`merge-gate-log-check` recipe)

# S3 — Durable store audit

### U-HE-14: Durable store audit one-pager + `tools/test_store_audit.py`

**Scope.** Author `.harness/spec/store-audit-he-loop-lanes.md` listing exactly the eight stores of C-HE-30's table plus the families the clearance fold adds (reservation generation dirs + `.seq` allocator, `transition.<token>` markers + `released.*/reclaimed.*` + `LEASE.<token>.*` sidecars, `QUEUE_DIR/lanes/<k>`, `hil-deliveries/`, `merge-door/attempts/` + `tier-clean-cycles/`, `.harness/mechanized-checks-state.json`, `.harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl`), each classified `derived` / `part of store N` / `sole carrier (new fact)` (spec v1.3 X3) with one authority per fact; and the static test that greps every `QUEUE_DIR`/`.harness` path literal in the four coordination modules and asserts each is listed. *As landed (PR for U-HE-14): the test also parses the eight-store and family tables (one row per store, authority cells bound to the C-HE-30 facts, Relation cells pinned, no fact owned twice) and the extractor covers pathlib / f-string / chained / call-root joins, `glob`, `with_suffix`, `.tmp` stagers and the shell `$(..)/<name>` idiom; S4 units MUST move their module from `PENDING` to `LANDED` in `tools/test_store_audit.py` when it lands.*

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-30 (table, invariants, verification: `tools/test_store_audit.py` phase0); §7; §11 #1.

**Files.** Create `.harness/spec/store-audit-he-loop-lanes.md`, `tools/test_store_audit.py`. Modify `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`, `tools/lanes_verify.py` (`Row("C-HE-30", "pytest:tools/test_store_audit.py", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`).

**Depends on.** U-HE-01, U-HE-05 (the audit names the sibling + probe log). It MUST land before U-HE-17 and U-HE-22 (spec §6: S3 before S4b/S4c).

# Durable store audit — H_E loop + lanes (C-HE-30)

Repo `17011f89c` · 2026-08-18 · owed before C-HE-03 / C-HE-06 code lands (spec §6 S3).
Rule: exactly one authority per fact. Any fact found with two authorities is resolved by demoting one to a derived copy before the corresponding contract is implemented.

## The eight stores

| Store | Venue | Authority for |
|---|---|---|
| Queue entries (`*.json` / `*.taken`) | `QUEUE_DIR` | "capture exists and is not yet in committed history" |
| Reservation files (`reservations/<arc_id>/<gen>.json`, immutable full snapshots; head = highest gen) | `QUEUE_DIR` | arc landing state (`pending/open/terminal`), `concurrent_lanes_at_open` sensor, `arc_type` at open, accreted `phases` |
| Merge-door lease (`merge-door/LEASE`) | `QUEUE_DIR`-adjacent | who is landing now; `merge_attempted_at`; `state ∈ {held, blocked}` |
| `.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl` (per-worktree until committed) | `REPO` | arc rows (`record_kind=arc`, one per `arc_id`), per-round outcomes, phases (folded at drain) |
| `.harness/merge-gate-log.md` + structured sibling `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` | `REPO` | gate verdicts and every finding-class row (human + machine views of ONE fact; the sibling is written by the same producer in the same step — a projection, not a second authority) |
| `loop_status.md` (HIL/NOTIFY rows at the shared venue `QUEUE_DIR/../loop_status.md`; control markers per-lane under `hook_project_dir()`) | shared / per-lane | operator-attention state; run-scoped skip-set |
| Finding emission (`codex_context_guard.Finding` projection) | CI/stdout | derived from the 8-field record — never authored independently |
| Committed history on `MERGED_REF` | git | the only proof that a row is durable |

## Derived families + new-fact carriers (no second authority for an existing fact)

*(v1.0 template headed "Derived families (no new authority)"; re-headed per spec v1.3 X3 — each row carries a `Relation` cell: `derived` / `part of store N` / `sole carrier (new fact)`. The as-landed page is canonical for the classifications; this template is illustrative.)*

| Family | Path | Relation | Derived from / sole carrier of |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reservation generations | `QUEUE_DIR/reservations/<arc_id>/<gen>.json`, `.<gen>.<pid>.tmp` | part of store 2 | the reservation files ARE store 2; head = highest gen, below-head = immutable history (GC prunes below head) |
| Reservation sequence allocator | `QUEUE_DIR/reservations/.seq/<n>` | sole carrier (new fact) | "the highest `seq` ever allocated" (`alloc_seq` exclusive-creates before the generation that carries it is written) |
| Lease transition marker | `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/transition.<lease_token>` (payload `{pid, host, target_action, created_at}` + `fresh_lease` on reclaim) | sole carrier (new fact) | "who won the transition of this token, toward what — and the fresh lease to publish" (C-HE-06 §6); completion is read from the history below |
| Lease per-token sidecars | `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/LEASE.<token>.<attempted|blocked|refresh>` | part of store 3 | `read_lease` merges them into the lease view (`merge_attempted_at`, blocked state, refresh continuation) |
| Lease transition history | `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/released.<token>`, `reclaimed.<token>` | part of store 3 | the renamed-aside `LEASE` payload = the lease's completed-transition record, read by recovery (GC 30 d) |
| Door attempt rate-window | `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/attempts/<lane_id>/<ts>` | sole carrier (new fact) | "attempts per lane in the window" (C-HE-06 rate limit) |
| Attestation-tier counter | `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/tier-clean-cycles/<token>` | sole carrier (new fact) | "consecutive clean cycles" (C-HE-06 §10) |
| Lane index registry | `QUEUE_DIR/lanes/<k>` | sole carrier (new fact) | "which lane indices are taken" (lane-init exclusive create; released at teardown) |
| HIL coalescing delivery claims | `QUEUE_DIR/hil-deliveries/<gen-id>` | sole carrier (new fact) | "one deliverer has claimed this generation" (`loop_hil_deliver`; the `COALESCE-DELIVERED` row is the delivery's audit twin) |
| Loop control markers (per-lane) | `.harness/.loop-active`, `.loop-iter`, `.loop-halt` | part of store 6 | pre-existing Wave-2 control state the C-HE-30 row 6 names ("control markers per-lane") |
| Mechanized-check runtime state | `.harness/mechanized-checks-state.json` | sole carrier (new fact) | "each check's live `kind` + demotion window" (C-HE-31 §4d; a promotion is recorded only here) |
| Mutation-probe run log | `.harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl` | sole carrier (new fact) | "which probe ran, when, against which digests" (probe-run evidence; annotations name which probes are required) |
| Structured gate sibling | `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` | part of store 5 | listed above with its markdown twin (JSONL-first, same step) |

## Two-authority checks performed

- "Is arc X landed?" — reservation state (`merged`) is authoritative for the *state machine*; `gh pr view` is ground truth the reservation is reconciled *from*; the arc row's `merged_at` is a capture. No conflict: reservation ← gh; row ← reservation at drain.
- "Who may append arc X?" — the `open` reservation's holder (`lane_id`), not the queue claim's pid/host (claim = seconds-scale liveness only; the named D2 exception transfers the holder in the same recovery step).
- "Is the door held?" — `LEASE` presence + `state`; `merge_attempted_at` folds into the lease (no third store).
- "Which HIL items are pending?" — the shared `loop_status.md` reduction; per-lane `.loop-active`/ACTIVATE are control markers, not HIL state.
```
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**; commit:
```bash
git add .harness/spec/store-audit-he-loop-lanes.md tools/test_store_audit.py tools/codex-parity-check.sh tools/lanes_verify.py
git commit -m "docs(he-lanes): U-HE-14 durable store audit one-pager + phase0 witness (C-HE-30)"
```
**Acceptance.** Test green at HEAD and re-green after U-HE-17/U-HE-22 land (the row re-runs; a new path literal not in the audit fails it — that is the "no runtime path creates a store the audit does not list" invariant).

# S4a — Primitive + drain guards + capture durability

### U-HE-15: Drain fault isolation — three FNF guards, per-arc isolation incl. `_claim_arc`, systemic abort, restore-or-republish, `KEPT QUEUED` only after durable restore

**Scope.** Restructure `drain()` around a per-entry `_drain_one()` so an exception while processing one entry — including inside `_claim_arc` — never abandons the rest; guard the three check-then-act `os.replace` sites with the file's `except FileNotFoundError` idiom; distinguish a systemic `OSError` (permission / I/O on `QUEUE_DIR`) which aborts the loop with one message; make every restore "succeed or re-publish from the in-memory capture" (E9/E21) so `KEPT QUEUED`/`kept` only follow a durable restore; add the `ARC_METRICS_TEST_KILL_AFTER=<step>` seam; and make `safe-worktree-remove.sh` (via `hook_worktree_local_state`) refuse to dispose a worktree that has committed-but-unpushed commits (`git rev-list @{u}..HEAD` non-empty), alongside the existing uncommitted-ledger refusal.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-04 §1 (guards at `:666`, `:746`, `:754`), §3 (fault isolation; systemic vs per-arc), §4 first sentence (re-publish on vanished entry), §7 (`AbortError` branch: restore succeeds or re-publishes; `KEPT QUEUED` only after durably back); §6 (teardown contract: refuse on uncommitted `.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl` — already caught — OR committed-but-unpushed commits — not checked today); C-HE-04 Invariants (no `FileNotFoundError` escapes; two-state invariant); C-HE-02 §4–§5 unchanged doctrine.

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`_recover_dead_claims` `:643-667`, `drain` `:670-762`; add helpers), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`; **teardown guard (C-HE-04 §6):** `tools/hooks/lib.sh:483-497` (`hook_worktree_local_state` gains the ahead-of-`@{u}` refusal), `tools/hooks/test_lib.sh`.

**Interfaces.**
```python
def _kill_after(step: str) -> None                      # os._exit(137) if ARC_METRICS_TEST_KILL_AFTER == step
def _restore_or_republish(taken: Path, path: Path, entry: dict) -> None
def _is_systemic(exc: OSError) -> bool
def _drain_one(path: Path, entry: dict, arc_id: str, committed: set[str], local: set[str]) -> str  # released|held|outstanding|added
```
Kill-step names (used by U-HE-20): `claim`, `extract`, `append`, `restore`, `restore-abort`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-10 (subprocess tests use the overrides).

        elif outcome in ("held", "outstanding"):
            kept += 1
```
(`import errno` at top. `_claim_arc` already converts non-race `OSError` into `AbortError` at `:629-633`; the systemic classification therefore has to happen **before** that conversion — change `_claim_arc`'s `except OSError as exc:` to `if _is_systemic(exc): raise` first, then the existing `raise AbortError(...)`.)
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**, probes: fault-isolation (`--lines` = the `except AbortError` clause in the loop) → PINNED; E9 (`--lines` = the `publish_exclusive` fallback in `_restore_or_republish`) → PINNED. Register `Row("C-HE-04", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_drain_fault_isolation", "phase0", "local + CI", True)` and `Row("C-HE-04", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_e9_capture_republish", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`.
- [ ] **Step 4b: Teardown guard (C-HE-04 §6) — rev 2026-08-19 (S4a execution correction, spec-exact scope).** Failing test in `tools/hooks/test_lib.sh` (the file's scratch-repo idiom): create a worktree with an upstream, commit locally without pushing → `hook_worktree_local_state <wt>` returns 0 with a residue line `ahead-of-upstream: 1 commit(s)`; push → returns 1 (clean); a worktree with NO upstream keeps today's clean verdict. *The v1.0 body additionally prescribed `no-upstream` as unconditional fail-closed residue; grounded at S4a execution that clause is unimplementable without flipping five existing safe-removal witnesses (test_lib.sh POST_SCAN rc 0 / HELD_CWD rc 7 / OPEN_UNKNOWN rc 9 / POST_IDENTITY rc 10 / the signal-recovery cases — `hook_worktree_local_state` gates removal before each of those paths) and without refusing every local-only scratch worktree in production. Spec C-HE-04 §6's MUST is scoped to `rev-list @{u}..HEAD` non-empty and is implemented exactly; the never-pushed-branch composition (unpushed local branch + a later manual branch delete — worktree disposal itself never deletes the branch, and branch-prune only prunes gh-merged head-refs) is a REGISTERED RESIDUAL of this unit. An upstream that RESOLVES but whose ahead-count fails stays fail-closed residue.* Implement in `lib.sh` `hook_worktree_local_state`, after the porcelain loop and before `[ -n "$residue" ] || return 1`:
```bash
  # C-HE-04 §6: committed-but-unpushed commits are capture a later branch prune
  # could lose -- with an upstream, ahead-of-@{u} is refusal residue. No upstream
  # keeps today's behavior (spec scopes the check to @{u}; residual registered).
  local ahead
  if git -C "$wt" rev-parse --verify -q '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    if ahead=$(git -C "$wt" rev-list --count '@{u}..HEAD' 2>/dev/null); then
      [ "${ahead:-0}" -gt 0 ] && residue="${residue}${residue:+
}ahead-of-upstream: ${ahead} commit(s)"
    else
      residue="${residue}${residue:+
}cannot count ahead-of-upstream (fail-closed)"
    fi
  fi
```
`safe-worktree-remove.sh` already refuses on any residue (rc 4/5 paths) — no change there. Mutation-probe: `just mutation-probe --file tools/hooks/lib.sh --lines <the ahead block> --test "bash tools/hooks/test_lib.sh"` → PINNED (committed-unpushed worktree would be removed). Register `Row("C-HE-04", "shell:tools/hooks/test_lib.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `git add tools/arc_metrics.py tools/test_arc_metrics.py tools/hooks/lib.sh tools/hooks/test_lib.sh tools/lanes_verify.py && git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-15 drain fault isolation + FNF guards + E9 restore-or-republish + kill seam + teardown ahead-of-upstream guard (C-HE-04 §1/§3/§4/§6/§7)"`.

### U-HE-16: C-HE-02 witnesses — dead-owner takeover unit, `flock` grep witness, kill-seam unit

**Scope.** Add the C-HE-02 static and unit witnesses: the scoped `flock|fcntl` grep over the three coordination modules (with the seven pre-existing `tools/hooks/**` users allowlisted by name), the two-simulated-dead-owner takeover unit (exactly one wins the second `publish_exclusive`), and a unit for the kill seam.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-02 §1 (no locks), §6 (liveness-predicate takeover; mutual exclusion by the second `publish_exclusive`), Invariants (grep witness scoped; allowlist), Verification (static + unit); C-HE-04 verification (vi) seam.

**Files.** Modify `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-15.

- [ ] **Step 1: Tests**
```python
COORD_MODULES = ["tools/arc_metrics.py", "tools/merge_door.py", "tools/reservations.py"]
LOCK_ALLOWLIST = {"tools/hooks/capture-failure.sh", "tools/hooks/subagent-validate.sh", "tools/hooks/loop-gc.sh", "tools/hooks/lib.sh",
                  "tools/hooks/test_capture_failure.sh", "tools/hooks/test_loop_gc.sh", "tools/hooks/test_lib.sh"}

def test_no_flock_fcntl_in_coordination_modules():
    """C-HE-02 invariant: rg -c 'flock|fcntl' over the three lane-coordination modules -> 0."""
    for m in COORD_MODULES:
        p = REPO / m
        if p.exists():
            assert not re.search(r"flock|fcntl", p.read_text()), m


# mutation-probe: make _claim_owner_is_dead return True for a live pid (unknown → dead)
def test_takeover_token_compare(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Two dead-owner takeovers on one claim: exactly one wins the second publish_exclusive; the loser yields."""
    q = tmp_path / "queue"; q.mkdir(); monkeypatch.setattr(am, "QUEUE_DIR", q)
    entry = {"pr": 5, "arc_id": "pr-5"}
    (q / "pr-5.json").write_text(json.dumps(entry))
    (q / "pr-5.taken").write_text(json.dumps({**entry, "_claim": {"pid": 999999, "host": socket.gethostname()}}))
    monkeypatch.setattr(am, "_process_is_alive", lambda pid: pid == os.getpid())
    wins = [am._claim_arc(q / "pr-5.json", entry), am._claim_arc(q / "pr-5.json", entry)]
    assert sum(w is not None for w in wins) == 1
    assert am._claim_owner_is_dead(q / "pr-5.taken") is False  # the winner (this pid) is alive


def test_kill_after_seam_exits_137(tmp_path):
    code = "import os; os.environ['ARC_METRICS_TEST_KILL_AFTER']='x'; import arc_metrics as am; am._kill_after('x'); print('alive')"
    r = subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-c", code], env={**os.environ, "PYTHONPATH": "tools"}, capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert r.returncode == 137 and "alive" not in r.stdout
```
- [ ] **Step 2–3:** RED only for the seam test if U-HE-15's `_kill_after` were absent; otherwise these are witnesses that go GREEN immediately — run the takeover probe to confirm it pins (`--lines` = the `not isinstance(pid, int) or host != socket.gethostname()` unknown-is-live guard in `_claim_owner_is_dead` `:596-598`) → PINNED.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Register `Row("C-HE-02", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_takeover_token_compare", "phase0", "local + CI", True)` and `Row("C-HE-02", "pytest:tools/test_arc_metrics.py::test_no_flock_fcntl_in_coordination_modules", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `git add tools/test_arc_metrics.py tools/lanes_verify.py && git commit -m "test(he-lanes): U-HE-16 C-HE-02 witnesses — takeover, lock-free grep, kill seam"`.

# S4b — Arc reservation (three-state, PR-tagged, generation-versioned)

### U-HE-17: `tools/reservations.py` — generation-CAS record, `alloc_seq`, `reserve`, `transition` with re-validate, `update_payload`, `transfer_holder`, `walk_terminal`, `gc`, `mint_lane_id`

**Scope.** Create the reservation module: one immutable full-snapshot JSON per generation under `QUEUE_DIR/reservations/<arc_id>/<gen>.json`, every mutation an exclusive-create CAS of `<n+1>.json` that re-validates the intended transition against the re-read head on `FileExistsError` (≤ 8), no rename/replace ever, filesystem-derived `seq`, `superseded_by` chain walk (depth 5, cycle raise), `arc_type` required at open, `lane_id` minting, GC of sub-head gens + orphaned tmp files.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-03 §1 (location, snapshot, CAS, re-validate, GC), §2 (states, `superseded_by`, chain), §3 (payload; `_provenance` not read by the state machine; `:`-free ids; `seq` allocator), §4 (transitions incl. selection-time refusal), §6 (holder rule; named D2 exception → `transfer_holder`), §8 (ordering key); C-HE-26 §1 (`arc_type` at open); C-HE-02 §1–§2 (CAS family; `QUEUE_DIR`-adjacent); C-HE-27 §3 (`phases` map accretes here — `record_phase`).

**Files.** Create `tools/reservations.py`, `tools/test_reservations.py`. Modify `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

**Interfaces.**

IMMUTABLE FULL SNAPSHOT created by exclusive create; the current record is the highest gen.
Every mutation is one CAS: read head n -> build the complete new payload -> exclusive-create
<n+1>.json. Losing the CAS means re-read, RE-VALIDATE the intended transition against the new
head's state, then retry (<= 8). There is no rename or replace on reservation records, ever.

States: pending -> open -> {merged | abandoned}. No tier reclaims on elapsed time (D8):
staleness is reconciled from ground truth or escalated to a human (see reconcile(), U-HE-18).
`_provenance.pid/host` MUST NOT be read by any state-machine decision -- the reservation spans
an hours-long handoff; liveness and validity are decoupled -- with the single named exception
of dead-claim recovery transfer (transfer_holder, C-HE-03 §6).

```

---

### U-HE-18: Reservation ground truth + staleness (`reconcile`), selection refusal wiring, `concurrent_lanes_at_open` sensor

**Scope.** Add `reconcile(arc_id, *, gh_view, superseded_by=None, now=None)` — `open` + MERGED → `merged`; CLOSED with pointer → `abandoned`; stuck > 24 h (PR OPEN or `pr` null) → `NOTIFY` + `DEFERRED-HIL`, state unchanged; `pending` aged > 24 h → `NOTIFY` + HITL, state unchanged; `gh` failure → "still open, not reclaimable"; add `open_with_sensor(arc_id, lane_id)` that flips `pending→open` recording `concurrent_lanes_at_open`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-03 §5 (ground truth; HITL never TTL), §7 (sensor, `derived`), §4 (`open→merged` on confirmed merge); C-HE-20 §1 (HITL queue via `DEFERRED-HIL`; `NOTIFY` for informational), §2 (never reclaim); C-HE-09 §5 (`NOTIFY` kind — U-HE-29).

**Rev 2026-08-20 (U-HE-18 execution corrections, as-built).** *(i) Superseder-must-exist:* the Step-1 literal test abandons `pr-22` with `superseded_by="pr-23"` never reserved; U-HE-17's landed round-6 validation (`transition.build` raises on a missing superseding reservation, C-HE-03 §2 chain resolvability) rejects that — the as-built test reserves `pr-23` first. *(ii) Probe substitution:* the Step-1 annotation ("add a reclaim-on-age") and Step 4's discussion name a positive mutation the deletion-only probe tool cannot express; the as-built deletion-expressible pins are: ground-truth test → drop the pending-aged `NOTIFY`/`DEFERRED-HIL` emission (rows assertions red); `test_ttl_never_reclaims` → drop `reconcile()`'s final stuck-open `return "open"` (terminus pinned); sensor test → drop the `sibling_open_count` snapshot line. *(iii) Hook path:* the session-start caller is `tools/roadmap-audit/session-start.sh` (Step 5's `tools/hooks/session-start.sh` does not exist); the pass is DETACHED (codex r1 P1: codex-session-start wraps the audit in an 8 s `hook_bounded` slice — an inline gh-backed pass could starve the audit emit), ACTIVATION-GATED on `loop_log_structured` existing in `loop_lib.sh` (codex r5 P2: dormant until U-HE-29 lands its writer, then self-activates — no emitter-less unattended pass), pre-probed on the reservations dir mirroring `arc_metrics.QUEUE_DIR`'s default, with durable outcomes surfacing via the loop ledger at the next engagement (pre-U-HE-29: the store-owned O_NOFOLLOW `.reconcile.log` — codex r2 P1 — surfaced as a `resv=ERR` context token by the NEXT session-start; loop-ledger rows take over at U-HE-29; the log is an operational pass record, NOT an escalation store — C-HE-20 §1 stands: escalation rows belong to the existing loop ledger, and until U-HE-29 lands its writer, emit_loop_row fails CLOSED per U-HE-17's landed contract, loud + in-band + exit 2). *(iv) Fault isolation:* `reconcile_all` isolates per-arc `ReservationError`s in-band (`ERROR: ...` value; CLI exit 2) so one arc's fail-closed `emit_loop_row` (loud until U-HE-29 lands `loop_log_structured`) cannot abandon the remaining pass; the merge-lane call lands with U-HE-22. *(v) Registered residuals (codex r4):* an unsupervised detached-launch failure (uv/import crash before the log write) leaves the prior log standing un-aged — supervising it inline would reintroduce the r1 budget P1, so the durable closure is U-HE-29's ledger rows + U-HE-22's synchronous merge-lane caller; and the plan carries an INTERNAL ordering contradiction this rev names rather than absorbs (codex r11): the §1 'Unit index (topological order)' + §3 deps table serialize U-HE-18 (S4b, #18) before U-HE-29 (S4d, #29) — the order #1405 executed (U-HE-17's landed emit_loop_row docstring: 'the first callers arrive with U-HE-18/U-HE-29') and the order the post-#1405 roadmap next-action prescribes — while the §0 ordering-rationale note item 2 (line ~52) says U-HE-29 'precedes S4b/S4c' so emitters have a target. The landed activation gate + fail-closed emitter make the executed order safe under either reading (no emitter-less unattended pass can fire); the note-vs-index contradiction itself is REGISTERED for reconciliation in the U-HE-29 body — full C-HE-20 row durability arrives with U-HE-29, not by re-sequencing; and (codex r7) RESOLVED-HIL auto-minting when a deferred-stale reservation later terminalizes cleanly belongs to U-HE-29's ledger-writer semantics (the DEFERRED/RESOLVED pairing is the ledger contract's, and pre-U-HE-29 reconcile's emits fail closed anyway) — U-HE-29 MUST also witness the session-start activation gate going live; and (merge-gate r1 concurrency P3) the CLOSED-without-pointer branch emits DEFERRED-HIL unconditionally per pass — spec-literal (C-HE-03 §5 Verification names no aged gate) and inert pre-U-HE-29; per-item dedup of repeated deferral rows is the ledger writer's keyed state machine (U-HE-29), not an aged-gate this unit may add without changing §5 semantics.*

### U-HE-19: Drain ⇄ reservation integration — flip-before-append, holder-gated `append`, dead-claim holder transfer, local-row reconciliation, phases fold

**Scope.** Wire `arc_metrics` to the reservation: at drain, per claimed entry (i) flip `pending→open` with holder = this lane (sensor), (ii) `append()` refuses unless this lane holds the `open` reservation, (iii) restore/hold; `_recover_dead_claims` transfers the holder to the recovering lane in the same step; drain start drops local uncommitted rows whose reservation is held/merged by another lane; the arc row takes `phases`, `concurrent_lanes_at_open`, `arc_type_open`, `lane_id`, `head_sha`, `base_sha` from the reservation.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-04 §2 (order + holder rule), §4 (holder transfer at recovery), §5 (local-row reconciliation), Invariants; C-HE-03 §4 (`pending→open` at drain start), §6 (holder rule; named D2 exception); C-HE-27 §3 (fold at drain, after the flip); C-HE-25 (`lane_id`, sensor on the row); C-HE-26 §1 (`arc_type_open` joins via `arc_id`).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`append`, `_recover_dead_claims`, `_drain_one`, `drain`, `cmd_extract`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-15, U-HE-17, U-HE-18.

**Rev 2026-08-20 (U-HE-19 execution corrections, as-built).** *(i) `record_phase` ts domain:* the Step-1 fold test's `ts="t0"` is rejected by U-HE-17's landed round-12 ISO-8601 validation; the as-built test records a valid `2026-08-20T00:00:00Z` edge. *(ii) Per-arc reservation-fault isolation:* the bootstrap `rs.emit_loop_row` NOTIFY fail-closes until U-HE-29 lands `loop_log_structured` (U-HE-17's landed contract); the as-built drain adds `rs.ReservationError` to both per-arc fault tuples (`_drain_one`'s restore tuple and `drain()`'s loop catch) so a raised emit — or a lost reserve race / a holder refusal — is a loud per-arc KEPT-QUEUED outcome, never a whole-drain abort (C-HE-04 §3's isolation doctrine, mirroring U-HE-18's `reconcile_all`). Reserve-before-emit means the legacy entry drains on the NEXT pass without re-emitting; witnessed by `test_bootstrap_emit_failure_is_per_arc_and_next_drain_proceeds`. *(iii) Holder transfer at BOTH dead-owner restore sites:* C-HE-04 §4's MUST covers the orphaned-aside restore path as well as the move-aside path; the as-built factors `_transfer_reservation_to_recoverer` and calls it at both — the deadness adjudication stays at the restore site, per the U-HE-17 `transfer_holder` docstring. *(iv) `_reconcile_local_rows` ordering:* early-return on an empty local ledger before the `committed_arc_ids()` git call (behavior-equal; avoids a per-drain git invocation on the empty path). *(v) Test-suite adaptation:* the legacy `_queue_entry` fixture gains `arc_type` (the bootstrap reserve enforces the C-HE-26 §1 domain), an autouse fixture isolates the reservation store + stubs the fail-closed emitter per test, and pre-reservation-era direct `append()` unit tests pass `require_holder=False` (they witness OTHER guards; the holder gate's witness is `test_append_refuses_unless_holder`, mutation-probe PINNED).* *(vi) Review-round corrections (codex r1–r4, each with a dedicated witness):* lane-stamped queue claims (`_claim` gains `lane_id`) so the D2 recovery transfer fires only when the dead claimant provably WAS the holder; transfer runs from the aside bytes BEFORE the restored name is public; the recoverer-dies-after-transfer double-fault stalls to the C-HE-03 §5 HITL escalation (fail-toward-stall, documented at the helper); `_reconcile_local_rows` runs under the ledger claim, guards the WHOLE per-row judgment, drops divergent duplicates of COMMITTED arcs (committed-line comparison is the §5 witness), and keeps merged-without-committed-row captures loudly; the drain-side `merged` branch holds (never releases) another lane's capture; the fold re-reads a FRESH head after `extract()` and stamps `arc_type_declared_at="open"` when the reservation is the capture point; the fallback lane id is stable per (host, worktree), trimming name+host never the path digest; the manual backfill mints its own reservation (reserve→open→append→merged) so the race fence is the store's exclusive-create CAS — no holder bypass remains, and backfill now requires `--arc-type` (C-HE-26 §1 parity with queue). *(vii) REGISTERED contradiction (codex r3 P1 vs r4 P2 oscillation — a genuine spec-internal tension, not a fix-loop):* C-HE-04 §2(ii)/C-HE-03 §6 authorize append for the OPEN holder only, while C-HE-06 §4(vi) flips `open→merged` at the merge door BEFORE the closure capture drains — under the post-U-HE-22 timeline a spec-literal open-only gate makes every normal capture undrainable. Landed reading: C-HE-03 §6 forbids *re*-append of a merged arc_id, not the merged HOLDER's own first capture — the gate admits `merged` heads whose `lane_id` is this lane (witness: `test_merged_holder_own_capture_drains_normally`; the ledger duplicate guard still forecloses second rows). Final wording routes to the U-HE-22 merge-lane landing (which owns the flip) for spec-side reconciliation.* *(viii) Later-round corrections (codex r5–r11, each witnessed):* drain terminalizes the open head it appended (generation-bound; a lost race re-folds the still-uncommitted local row via `_refold_local_row`, and the held-pass merged-ours branch heals a failed refold idempotently); the backfill (`cmd_extract`) is scoped to reservation-less history or reservations it minted itself (`branch="historical-backfill"` + recorded pr/arc_type agreement), validates merged-fields and declared-at BEFORE minting, and terminalizes before append so a crash self-heals through the merged-holder gate; the merged-path append admission is fenced by a TRI-STATE committed-history read (unreadable or unparseable committed lines HOLD, never fail open); local-row reconciliation discriminates by reservation (peer-superseded rows converge to the committed canonical line; pending relabels and baseline content are kept; a committed aid keeps exactly one occurrence); the C-HE-04 manifest carries one row per contract section. *(ix) HELD residuals (registered, fail-toward-stall per D8):* a lane dying between the open→merged flip and its first append leaves a merged headless capture NO peer can transfer (`transfer_holder` is open-only) — the entry holds loudly to HITL; and the committed-history fence reads the LOCAL `MERGED_REF` snapshot, so a stale remote-tracking ref bounds its freshness (fetch cadence is the operator envelope). Both route to the U-HE-22 merge-lane landing with the item-(vii) contradiction; additionally (r14) the backfill sentinel `BACKFILL_BRANCH` is spoofable through the reservations CLI's free-form `branch` argument — accepted under the store's documented cooperative-trust posture (the U-HE-17 `transfer_holder` docstring: a cooperative-coordination CAS, not a security fence, exactly as `transition()` trusts its caller's `lane_id`); a store-side domain refusal belongs to a reservations-module rev, not this unit. *(x) Adjudicated reviewer flip (r16 vs r18):* r16 demanded the backfill row fold its minted reservation's `lane_id`/sensor; r18 correctly reversed — those are false derived data measured long after a historical arc ran, and C-HE-25's own model is additive-null for historical rows. As-built: the backfill adopts ONLY the operator-declared classification; lane/sensor stay null (witness: `test_cmd_extract_backfill_reserves_first_and_holder_rule_stands`). With that adjudication and the item-(vii)/(ix) registered holds, the out-of-family loop reached its terminal state at r18 (12 consecutive rounds re-raising the registered merged-gate class; per the reviewer-oscillation register-and-hold discipline the remaining BLOCK carries only held/adjudicated classes and final adjudication passes to the 3-lens merge gate). *(xi) r19 terminal-round adjudications:* the bootstrap's honoring of a closure entry's `--arc-type-declared-at open` (r13's own demand) was re-raised at r19 as provenance fabrication — HELD as-built: arc-type declarations are operator judgements by the row model ('declared by operator, never inferred'), the CLI option exists for pre-reservation flows that knew the open-time label, and the reservation becomes sole authority only once U-HE-21 mints real open-time records; and the backfill resume fence binding (pr + arc_type, not the full declarations payload) stays within the cooperative-trust posture — two racing manual invocations resolve to exactly ONE row via the ledger claim + duplicate guard, the loser is refused loudly, and close-time corrections go through `relabel_arc_type_close`. *(xii) Post-terminal rounds (codex r20–r22 + merge-gate rounds 1–2), each witnessed:* the dead-claim takeover transfers from the stashed evidence at STASH time (adjudicated r15-vs-r20 tension: a live self-holder progresses on its own next pass; death degrades to the §5 stall posture); the backfill stamps `pr` at mint time (shrinking the resume fence's pr-null window to the reserve→stamp instant); `_reconcile_local_rows` gains its own TRI-STATE stops — unreadable AND unparseable committed history reconcile NOTHING (distinct from the merged-append fence's tri-state, item viii); the drain fold's sha provenance is witnessed (`head_sha`/`base_sha` asserted); the drain HOLDS (never consumes) a `BACKFILL_BRANCH` reservation in EVERY state — pending, open, or merged — since same-worktree lane identity cannot distinguish the backfill's flow from drain's (merge-gate r1 pending, r2 open/merged); and the FOURTH dead-owner consumption site (the swept-leftover-claim branch) carries its own transfer witness (merge-gate r1 witness lens).*

### U-HE-20: AC#2 subprocess harness — `tools/test_arc_metrics_lanes.py` (six interleavings + cross-latency)

**Scope.** Real-subprocess lanes (`subprocess.Popen`, own git-inited worktree per lane, own `ARC_METRICS_REPO`/`ARC_METRICS_LEDGER`, shared `QUEUE_DIR`), a filesystem rendezvous barrier bounded 30 s, the six parametrized interleavings of AC#2(a), the sequential AC#2(b) cross-latency case, assertions over the **union** of lane ledgers. Never threads, never `multiprocessing` fork.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-04 Verification (AC#2(a) i–vi, seam, union assertion, NOT threads/fork), C-HE-03 Verification (AC#2(b)), §8 AC#2, C-HE-05 §2–§3.

**Files.** Create `tools/test_arc_metrics_lanes.py`. Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`_hold_after` seam — sibling of `_kill_after`), `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-19, U-HE-16.

- [ ] **Step 1: Seam** — beside `_kill_after` in `arc_metrics.py`:
```python
def _hold_after(step: str) -> None:
    """Test seam: ARC_METRICS_TEST_HOLD_AFTER=<step> -> touch <HOLD_DIR>/<step>.reached and wait (<= 30 s) for
    <HOLD_DIR>/<step>.go. Lets a test interleave a peer action at an exact point (C-HE-04 (iii)/(iv)/(v))."""
    if os.environ.get("ARC_METRICS_TEST_HOLD_AFTER") != step:
        return
    hold = Path(os.environ["ARC_METRICS_TEST_HOLD_DIR"])
    (hold / f"{step}.reached").touch()
    deadline = time.monotonic() + 30
    while not (hold / f"{step}.go").exists():
        if time.monotonic() > deadline:
            raise AbortError(f"hold seam timeout at {step}")
        time.sleep(0.02)
```
and call `_hold_after(step)` immediately after each `_kill_after(step)` in `_drain_one` (same step names).
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the harness** — `tools/test_arc_metrics_lanes.py`:
```python
"""AC#2 (a)/(b): real subprocess lanes over one shared QUEUE_DIR. NOT threads (module globals cannot diverge
per thread -- a false-GREEN certificate), NOT multiprocessing fork. Every case asserts over the UNION of lane
ledgers: one row per arc_id, and the C-HE-04 two-state invariant."""

```

**Rev 2026-08-20 (U-HE-20 execution corrections, as-built).** *(i) RED evidence (Step 3):* scratch worktree at `8638f2e7` (pre-U-HE-19, via `git worktree add`; disposed through `safe-worktree-remove.sh` after attaching `scratch/he20-red-disposable` — the detached-HEAD refusal is the U-HE-15 guard working as designed): `test_ac2_b_cross_latency` FAILED there with "B re-appended across PR-merge latency (X4)" (the spec's RED with no fault injection) and `test_ac2_a_same_instant[vi-killed-after-append]` FAILED at the reconciliation witness; both pass at HEAD (7/7). *(ii) Fixture corrections against HEAD:* the sketch's `round_snapshot` lacked `round_log_source`/`first_round_at`/`last_round_at` (extract reads them unconditionally); the fake `gh` `mergeCommit.oid` must be 40 chars (`ci_metrics` refuses short SHAs); lane worktrees are FRESH repos with no `origin/main` (spec-literal; `committed_arc_ids()` returns `set()` through the real unreadable-`MERGED_REF` path, and a regression there surfaces through the lane-termination check) — (vi) ALONE publishes a one-BASELINE-row committed ledger at `origin/main` (codex U-HE-20 r2 P2), because its final legs judge local rows against committed content; an EMPTY committed ledger is indistinguishable from an unreadable one through `run()`'s non-empty-output validation (`tools/arc_metrics.py:212-213`), so `_committed_ledger_lines()` returns None and reconciliation correctly holds (fail-safe; registered as an observation — a brand-new repo whose committed ledger is empty never reconciles local rows until a first row lands). *(iii) Interleaving (ii):* the dead claim's pid is a REAPED child's, provably dead on every platform (codex U-HE-20 r2 P3 — a fixed sentinel can be live where pid_max exceeds it); the dead `.taken` claim must carry `lane_id` (`_transfer_from_dead_claim` refuses an unstamped claim — U-HE-19 rev item (vi)); after the same-instant recovery race, a deterministic completion leg re-drains the transferred holder (the claim race may go to the non-holder in the barrier pass; a fixed 3-pass retry was a flake window), asserting the holder moved off `dead-lane` and the appended row's `lane_id` equals the reservation's. *(iv) Probe re-siting:* `append()`'s `_require_reservation_holder` is a SECOND serial guard, so commenting a drain-side elif alone still yields zero rows — (iv)/(v)/(b) therefore assert the drain-side classification MESSAGE, which makes the elif mutations killable; the sketch's "holder check with `-k iv`" pin lands at `-k v` (at the `restore` hold point the reservation is already `merged` — terminalization precedes the restore in `_drain_one` — so (iv) exercises the merged-held elif, (v) the open-held elif); pins: re-publish fallback ↦ (iii), `transfer_holder` ↦ (ii), open-held elif ↦ (v), merged-held elif ↦ AC#2(b). *(v) Interleaving (vi) vs the landed C-HE-04 §5:* the sketch's "A's resumed drain drops its orphaned local row" predates U-HE-19's as-built refinement (rev items (vi)/(ix), codex r2 P1): a merged-by-other row with NO committed replacement row is KEPT LOUDLY ("local row kept pending reconciliation" — merged state alone does not prove the replacement row exists; dropping could discard the only capture). The as-built test witnesses the FULL landed story: kill → recovery + holder transfer → B's row lands → A's resume keeps loudly (transient two-copy union, entry held, no double-append) → B's canonical row promoted into A's committed history → A's next drain converges the stale copy to the committed canonical line and releases the entry. The drop-at-committed-point reading routes with the U-HE-19 item-(vii)/(ix) residuals to the U-HE-22 merge-lane landing for spec-side reconciliation of the (vi) sentence. HELD against codex U-HE-20 r1 P2 → r2 P1 (the reviewer re-raises the spec-literal immediate-drop reading): asserting the immediate drop would RED against the 22-round-reviewed landed §5 — the safety property AC#2 protects is merged-HISTORY uniqueness (C-HE-03 Invariants: at most one row for the arc_id ever reaches merged history), which the convergence leg asserts exactly; the transient two-local-copy state satisfies the C-HE-04 two-state invariant (entry held, rows uncommitted). Adjudication passes to the 3-lens merge gate per the register-and-hold discipline. *(r6 additions:)* the (vi) leg carries its own PINNED behavioral kill (comment the §5 replaced-with-committed convergence block → the final convergence assertion goes red), so kill-after-append has HEAD-behavioral RED evidence beyond the process-level scratch-worktree record — a cross-commit RED cannot be a probe pin by construction (the tool mutates HEAD only), and the rc≠0 log rows the reviewer read as "the RED record" are refused/mis-ranged invocations the append-only run log keeps honestly (never counted by `_pin_is_live`); the (ii) dead-pid in-test reuse window is closed by asserting neither racing lane was allocated the reaped pid (the external window is production's own D2 seconds-scale liveness posture). 20 probes PINNED, coverage 0, at the terminal HEAD. *(v-bis) Mid-restore concurrency (codex U-HE-20 r3 P2):* a `restore-link` hold seam lands INSIDE `_restore_or_republish` (between the exclusive re-link and the claim unlink) so (iv) interleaves B's claim DURING A's restore — the takeover is refused by A's LIVE claim (exclusive create, never timing; B classifies it outstanding and yields), then B's post-restore claim witnesses the merged-held elif; (v) likewise interleaves mid-abort-restore at the same seam, then witnesses the open-holder elif on a post-restore claim (codex r4 P2); the same-instant barrier is TWO-PHASE (each lane reports `<lane>.ready` before polling `.go`; the parent releases only after both — codex r4 P2); the (ii) dead pid is a reaped child's, re-verified dead by `kill(0)` at stamp time with the residual reuse window documented as production's own (codex r4 P3). *(vi) Lane termination validated:* `_finish` asserts every lane exits through the documented outcome classes (0/1; the kill leg 137) with no traceback — the losing racer logs and yields (C-HE-04 §1). *(vii) C-HE-30 audit:* the `_hold_after` rendezvous artifacts (`<HOLD_DIR>/<step>.reached`/`<step>.go`) are listed in the ephemeral-artifacts table of `store-audit-he-loop-lanes.md` (test-only, never production env). *(viii) §8.1 row-count note:* the spec's §8.1 lanes row says "(5 interleavings)" while the C-HE-04 Verification body (clearance fold G6) enumerates six — the stale count is informational; the Verification body governs and six are parametrized.*

### U-HE-21: Reservation CLI wiring into `roadmap-continue` and `ship-pr`

**Scope.** `roadmap-continue` creates the `pending` reservation with `--arc-type` the instant it selects the roadmap unit (refusing selection when `selectable` says no); `ship-pr` back-fills `pr`, `head_sha`, `base_sha` at PR creation / final gate and `attested_merge_tree` at final-gate time; both export `HARNESS_ARC_ID`; `session-start.sh` runs `reconcile-all`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-03 §3 (back-fill fields; `lane_id` from `HARNESS_LANE_ID`), §4 (`(none)→pending` at arc open, before any work; second lane's selection fails), C-HE-26 §1 (open-time capture point is this reservation, not the closure-time queue); C-HE-06 §4(ii) consumer of `attested_merge_tree`.

**Files.** Modify `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md`, `tools/hooks/session-start.sh`; add `tools/hooks/test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh` (grep witness that the skills carry the exact commands).

**Depends on.** U-HE-17, U-HE-18.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test** — `tools/hooks/test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh` (same `ok/bad` idiom as `test_skill_two_lane.sh`):
```bash
RC=.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md; SP=.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md
grep -q 'python tools/reservations.py reserve --arc-id' "$RC" && ok "roadmap-continue reserves at selection" || bad "no reserve step"
grep -q 'python tools/reservations.py selectable --arc-id' "$RC" && ok "selection checks selectable" || bad "no selectable check"
grep -q -- '--arc-type' "$RC" && ok "arc_type declared at open" || bad "arc_type not at open"
grep -q 'reservations.py update --arc-id .* --set pr=' "$SP" && ok "ship-pr back-fills pr" || bad "no pr back-fill"
grep -q 'attested_merge_tree=' "$SP" && ok "ship-pr records attested_merge_tree" || bad "no attested tree"
grep -q 'export HARNESS_ARC_ID' "$RC" && ok "HARNESS_ARC_ID exported" || bad "no HARNESS_ARC_ID"
grep -q 'reservations.py reconcile-all' tools/hooks/session-start.sh && ok "session-start reconciles" || bad "no reconcile-all"
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Carrier edits.**
  - `roadmap-continue/SKILL.md`, in the "derive next action" step, insert after the unit is chosen: *"**Arc open (C-HE-03 §4).** Before any work: `ARC_ID=<unit-id-or-pr-slug>`; `uv run python tools/reservations.py selectable --arc-id "$ARC_ID" || { echo 'reserved by another lane — pick the next unit'; <re-derive>; }`; then `uv run python tools/reservations.py reserve --arc-id "$ARC_ID" --lane-id "$HARNESS_LANE_ID" --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --arc-type <inventing|applying>` (declare the type NOW — C-HE-26 §1); `export HARNESS_ARC_ID="$ARC_ID"`."*
  - `ship-pr/SKILL.md`: after `gh pr create` → `uv run python tools/reservations.py update --arc-id "$HARNESS_ARC_ID" --set pr=<N> head_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD) base_sha=$(git rev-parse origin/main)`; at final gate (before the merge door) → `uv run python tools/reservations.py update --arc-id "$HARNESS_ARC_ID" --set head_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD) base_sha=$(git rev-parse origin/main) attested_merge_tree=$(git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main HEAD)`.
  - `session-start.sh`: `uv run python tools/reservations.py reconcile-all >/dev/null 2>&1 || true` (advisory at start; the merge lane runs it blocking).
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**, register `Row("C-HE-03", "shell:tools/hooks/test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`, commit:
```bash
git add .claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md .claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md tools/hooks/session-start.sh tools/hooks/test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh tools/lanes_verify.py
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-21 reservation carriers — open-time pending + arc_type, ship-pr back-fill (C-HE-03 §3-4, C-HE-26 §1)"
```

**Rev 2026-08-20 (U-HE-21 execution corrections, as-built).** *(i) Session-start carrier path + already-landed pass:* the Files line's `tools/hooks/session-start.sh` does not exist — the real SessionStart carrier is `tools/roadmap-audit/session-start.sh` (registered at the U-HE-18 rev item (iii)), and the C-HE-03 §5 `reconcile-all` pass itself LANDED with U-HE-18 (detached, activation-gated, `--log-to-store`) — this unit's Step-3 hook edit is therefore a no-op; the as-built Step-1 witness greps the real path and pins the landed invocation against removal. *(ii) Lane-id mint fallback:* `HARNESS_LANE_ID` is exported by U-HE-31's lane-init, not yet landed; the carrier mints one when unset (`reservations.py mint-lane-id`, the CLI U-HE-17 shipped) so open-time reservations never block on the not-yet-built lane-init. *(iii) Same-lane re-entry:* `selectable()` is false for ANY existing head — including this lane's own `pending` after a crash/compaction re-entry — so the carrier adds a `show`-based same-lane resume clause (continue WITHOUT re-reserving when the head's `lane_id` is ours); the C-HE-03 §4 second-lane refusal is unchanged. *(iv) Line-based witness:* the Step-1 grep patterns are line-based by construction; the PR-creation back-fill lands as a single-line command in ship-pr. *(v) Go-live witness (closes the U-HE-19 rev item (xi) hold):* this arc dogfooded its own wiring — the first REAL open-time reservation was minted for `u-he-21` itself (gen 1, `pending`, `arc_type=applying` with `arc_type_declared_at=open`, seq 1) before the carrier edits were committed; with `HARNESS_ARC_ID` now exported at open and ship-pr back-filling the merge tuple, the review-wrapper `branch-*` arc-id fallback, the R17-a/b same-(producer, round) wrapper residual (flow-excluded by the arc-serial holder discipline), and the `update_payload` merge-tuple single-writer-by-flow note (codex round-2 P2) all have their real producers; the door-side consumer of `attested_merge_tree` remains U-HE-22 (recording starts at this unit, byte-compare at the door lands there).* *(vi) Round-1 codex corrections (each witnessed by the strengthened grep suite):* shell exports do not survive across Bash tool invocations, so the carriers now pass every id/SHA as a LITERAL (no `$( )`, single clean invocations) with `export HARNESS_ARC_ID` scoped same-shell and the inline `HARNESS_ARC_ID=<arc> HARNESS_LANE_ID=<lane> just review-with-failover` form for the wrapper's env consumers; the arc-open block is a real two-branch flow (`selectable` exit 0 → reserve; exit 1 → `show`, same-lane head resumes WITHOUT re-reserving since `reserve()` refuses any existing head, other-lane head re-derives — the sketch's unconditional reserve-after-show always raised); the clearance marker is renamed to the `...-v1-u-he-21-as-built-rev-...` shape so `artifact_heads.py`'s filename tie-break (same numeric v1.0 + same date as the U-HE-20 marker) resolves THIS rev as the family head. *REGISTERED residual (→ **U-HE-25**, the guard-modification unit — the codex-r3 correction of r1's mis-route to U-HE-23, which touches only `merge_door.py`):* the guard's allowlist covers neither `uv run python tools/reservations.py`, nor leading `HARNESS_*=` env-prefix assignments, nor `git merge-tree`, so in loop mode each mandatory reservation/review command surfaces one approval prompt; the three allowlist additions are now REGISTERED VERBATIM in U-HE-25's Scope line (this session's classifier also hard-blocks guard self-modification from a background job — consistent with routing to the planned reviewed guard unit).* *(vii) Round-2 codex corrections:* the lane id is minted ONCE per worktree and persisted at gitignored `.harness/.lane-id` (a per-session re-mint's fresh random suffix would make same-lane resume misclassify its own reservation — the wrapper's stable fallback and C-HE-03 §3's "minted at lane init" both presume persistence; durable minting remains U-HE-31's); ship-pr's PRE-FLIGHT review invocation carries the inline `HARNESS_*` prefix too (ship-pr is independently invocable — a bare invocation would write `branch-*`/`-nolane` fallback ids into the C-HE-24/25 rows); and the reviewer's door-timing P1 — the reservation is still `pending` at ship-pr's final gate while C-HE-06 acquisition demands an `open` holder (the only production `pending→open` flip is drain, which runs post-merge) — is REGISTERED into the existing flip-timing contradiction class routed to the U-HE-22 merge-lane landing (U-HE-19 rev item (vii): C-HE-04 §2(ii)/C-HE-03 §6 vs C-HE-06 §4(vi)); the door carrier owns where the flip lands, this unit's payload-only `update` is valid on a pending head either way. *HELD (rounds 2–3 re-raise of the registered guard-friction class):* the loop-mode approval prompts stand until U-HE-25's reviewed guard edit (three allowlist additions now registered verbatim in its Scope; U-HE-25 sits in the same S4c cluster, two units ahead in the §3 topological order); the carrier is fully usable interactively today, the shapes are never DENIED (witnessed — a deny would structurally block the loop; an ask merely pauses it), and the classifier block on background-session guard self-modification makes the in-arc alternative unavailable by policy, not by omission — adjudication passes to the 3-lens merge gate per the register-and-hold discipline.* *(viii) Round-4 codex corrections:* the reviewer's headless citation is CONFIRMED (`tools/04-loop/run.sh:18` — ask→deny in the headless runner), which upgrades the friction to "headless arcs cannot reserve at open pre-U-HE-25"; the carrier now states the explicit DEGRADATION rather than a stall: a permission-refused reserve → proceed UNRESERVED + note in the PR body — append safety is already held by the LANDED U-HE-19 drain bootstrap (reservation minted at closure) + the C-HE-03 §6 holder gate; only §4 selection-time scheduling dedup defers to U-HE-25 for headless lanes (attended lanes reserve today, one prompt per command). Also absorbed: the selectable→reserve TOCTOU (a lost `reserve` race is handled identically to the occupied-selectable path — `show` and branch); the lane-id mint write race (file content is authoritative: never overwrite, re-read after write and adopt the winner; same-worktree concurrent sessions are out-of-discipline — one worktree IS one lane — and atomic exclusive-create minting is registered to U-HE-31 lane-init); and the guard witness leg is hardened per the gate-cannot-tell-empty-from-unlooked rule — pipeline failure is loud (`PIPELINE_FAILURE` ≠ ask), and a positive control (force-push → deny) runs FIRST so an inert guard cannot silently satisfy the never-denied floor.* *(ix) Round-5 codex corrections:* the CANONICAL step-4 review invocation now carries the inline `HARNESS_*` prefix (round 2 had fixed only the arc-open paragraph's example — the loop body's own command was still bare, so following the skill verbatim wrote fallback ids; the witness now asserts EVERY `review-with-failover` mention in both carriers is prefixed, not merely that one prefixed example exists); the resume branches check `state` BEFORE `lane_id` (a terminal head owned by this lane satisfied the equality branch first — a completed/abandoned arc could be resumed; terminal heads are now never resumed regardless of owner); and ship-pr's back-fills gain the unreserved-skip clause (`show` reports no reservation → skip both back-fills + PR-body note — `update` on a nonexistent reservation aborts, and the closure-time reservation is the drain bootstrap's), making the headless degradation path coherent END-TO-END rather than only at open. *HELD (round-5 re-raises of registered/held classes):* require-allow in the witness would gate this unit on U-HE-25's registered scope (ask is the documented pre-U-HE-25 state; deny is the pinned regression); the lane-id mint's atomic exclusive-create belongs to U-HE-31 lane-init (registered — the file-content-authoritative rule bounds the crash-overlap edge, and same-worktree concurrent sessions are out-of-discipline); the land-guard-support-now demand remains classifier-blocked in this venue and registered verbatim at U-HE-25.* *(x) Round-6 codex corrections:* BOTH U-HE-25 registration matchers narrowed to exact shapes (r6's two live P2s — the bare `tools/reservations.py` prefix would have auto-approved `transition`/`gc`; the generic `HARNESS_[A-Z0-9_]+` strip would have let `HARNESS_FAILOVER_CHILD=1 just gemini-review` skip outcome persistence — now `selectable|show|reserve|update|mint-lane-id` verbs and `HARNESS_ARC_ID=`/`HARNESS_LANE_ID=` names only); the headless degradation trigger broadened to ANY refused arc-open command (`mint-lane-id`/`selectable`/`reserve` — r6 P1a: handling only `reserve` left the clause unreachable since the earlier commands deny first), with a refused PREFIXED review degrading to the bare allowlisted `just review-with-failover` (fallback ids = the pre-U-HE-21 posture; its ALLOW floor is now witnessed so losing the allowlist entry cannot silently strand headless review); and the flip-timing class (r6 P1b re-raise) now has a REGISTERED CARRIER LINE in U-HE-22's own Scope — the door unit must either admit the `pending` holder-elect at acquire or open pre-acquire at ship-pr's final gate, reconciling C-HE-03 §4/§6 vs C-HE-06 §4(vi) there (it is no longer only a rev-note residual).* *(xi) Terminal round (codex r7 — the guard class's 7th consecutive raise; register-and-hold terminal, as at U-HE-20):* absorbed — `mint-lane-id` added to the guard-adjudication matrix (an explicit deny of lane-id initialization would otherwise stay green), and the headless degradation is documented as a DISTINCT EXPLICIT CONTRACT at the witness's adjudication section (the reviewer's accepted alternative formulation). HELD with terminal adjudication passing to the 3-lens merge gate: the r7 P1 frames the degradation as "failing open" on C-HE-03 §4 dedup, but pre-U-HE-21 headless lanes had NO selection-time dedup at all — the degradation is byte-identical to the baseline posture for a venue that cannot yet execute the new commands (no allowlisted wrapper exists without a guard edit; the guard edit is classifier-blocked from this venue and registered exact-shape at U-HE-25) — so the carrier is a strict coverage INCREASE (attended lanes gain §4 dedup now, headless lanes at U-HE-25 — which the post-#1411 roadmap execution order reaches in S4c, before the still-unlanded S4d activation-gate unit U-HE-29 whose go-live witness the roadmap routes there); and the lane-id exclusive-create re-raise (4th) remains registered to U-HE-31 lane-init with the file-content-authoritative rule bounding the crash-overlap edge.*

# S4c — Merge-door lease + wrapper + X9 fences

### U-HE-22: `tools/merge_door.py` lease primitive — acquire (fail-fast, rate limit, holder invariant), transition marker, release / reclaim / self-resume / unblock, poison-pill completion, GC

**Scope.** Create the merge-door lease: single global `QUEUE_DIR/merge-door/LEASE` (immutable JSON created by exclusive create, payload per C-HE-06 §3), token-named sidecars for `merge_attempted_at` and `blocked` (payload CAS = temp + `os.link` onto a token-named name), the `transition.<lease_token>` marker family through which every release / reclaim / unblock / self-resume passes, third-party idempotent completion of a dead creator's marker, the K=5/60 s per-lane rate limit, and GC of markers + history (30 d). **Registered from U-HE-21 (codex r2/r6 on that PR — the flip-timing class, joint with U-HE-19 rev item (vii)):** a normally-opened arc's reservation is still `pending` at ship-pr's final gate (the only landed `pending→open` flip is the drain's, which runs at closure AFTER merge), while `acquire()`'s holder invariant as sketched admits only an `open` holder — wired as sketched, the door rejects every normal arc. This unit MUST resolve the acquire-time state contract: either `acquire()` admits the arc's `pending` holder-elect (flipping at step (vi) with `merged`), or the ship-pr final gate performs the open flip pre-acquire — and the C-HE-03 §4/§6 vs C-HE-06 §4(vi) spec wording reconciles HERE with the rest of the registered class.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-06 §2 (primitive; fail-fast; rate limit not counted against budget), §3 (payload), §6 (marker; two-step reclaim; poison-pill; self-resume via reclaim; unblock keyed to `blocked_at_sha`; reclaim transfers merge authority, not reservation ownership), §7 (lease-holder invariant P2), Invariants (no lease without `pr`/`head_sha`/`reservation_id`/`lease_token`; no path-only unlink); C-HE-02 §1–§3.

**Files.** Create `tools/merge_door.py`, `tools/test_merge_door.py`. Modify `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

**Interfaces.**
```python
DOOR = QUEUE_DIR / "merge-door"; LEASE = DOOR / "LEASE"
RATE_K = 5; RATE_WINDOW_S = 60; GC_KEEP_DAYS = 30
class LeaseError(RuntimeError); class LeaseHeld(LeaseError); class RateLimited(LeaseError); class HolderInvariant(LeaseError); class MarkerLost(LeaseError); class DoorBlocked(LeaseError)
def read_lease() -> dict | None                                # LEASE + sidecars merged into one view (state, merge_attempted_at, blocked_*)

def unblock(*, pr: int, blocked_at_sha: str, lane_id: str) -> None
def complete_dead_marker(marker: Path) -> bool
def gc(*, now=None) -> list[Path]
```

**Rev 2026-08-20 (U-HE-22 execution corrections, as-built — primitive half).** *(i) Contention test defect in the sketch:* `_acq(lane="B", arc="pr-1")` trips the P2 HolderInvariant on A's arc BEFORE reaching the door and never exercises contention; the as-built test reserves+opens `pr-2` for B so B passes P2 and hits the held LEASE (LeaseHeld). *(ii) Deterministic deadness:* the fixture patches `md._process_is_alive` to "alive iff this process" — the sketch's fixed sentinel pid 999999 can be a LIVE pid where pid_max exceeds it (Linux CI default 4194304; the U-HE-20 r2 P3 class), so the sentinel never reaches the real `kill(0)` probe. *(iii) tools-test import idiom:* `sys.path.insert(0, <tools dir>)` before `import merge_door` (the repo's `--import-mode=importlib` posture; same as test_reservations), and `tools/test_merge_door.py` is registered in `codex-parity-check.sh`'s named pytest list. *(iv) Module surface:* imports trimmed to the primitive half's actual uses (U-HE-23 re-adds `subprocess`/`ci_is_green`/`REPO` etc. with the land driver); the §4/§8 constants (`MERGE_TIMEOUT_S`, bounds, `BACKOFF`, `KILL_STEPS`) land now as declared; exception names keep the plan's verbatim signatures under `# noqa: N818`, the `reservations.py` precedent. *(v) Probe re-siting (deletion-expressibility):* the contention pin is the `raise LeaseHeld` line alone (its `msg =` line keeps the except-block syntactically valid, so the mutation falls through to a successful-looking return — killable); the third-party-completion pin is the `_move_lease` line alone (the sketch's two-line range emptied the if-body and was refused); reclaim's foreign-adoption and crashed-reclaimer annotations are re-shaped to deletion-expressible ranges (the post-publish token re-check; the `_publish_fresh` completion line). 7 probes PINNED, coverage 0. *(vi) Store audit:* `tools/merge_door.py` promoted PENDING→LANDED in `test_store_audit.py` (its path literals were pre-declared at the U-HE-14/v1.3 audit; the audit re-runs green). *(vii) Spec v1.4 discharge (same PR):* the four registered wording classes routed to this landing — flip-timing (C-HE-03 §4 merge-lane pre-acquire opener + C-HE-06 acquisition-scoped open-ness invariant, closing plan §6 item 13's candidate), merged-gate carve-out (C-HE-03 §6 + C-HE-04 §2(ii)), keep-loudly/converge (C-HE-04 §5 + Verification (vi), incl. the MERGED_REF freshness bound + merged-headless stall), and the §8.1 six-interleavings count — land as the spec v1.4 change-note with marker `spec-he-loop-lanes-v1.4-cleared-2026-08-20.md`; `acquire()`'s P2 comment now cites the v1.4 note instead of an unresolved candidate.* *(viii) Review-round corrections (codex r1–r2, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* reclaim AND release adjudicate from the PERSISTED lease, never the caller's dict (a copied dict with a substituted pid must not displace a live holder; a stale dict must never move ANOTHER lane's lease aside — `_move_lease` renames the CURRENT LEASE while the marker namespace is per-token); a `blocked` door resumes/releases ONLY through the operator-keyed `unblock` (both verbs refuse with `DoorBlocked`); reclaim re-checks the LINKED RESERVATION (`open`/`merged` only — an operator-abandoned arc whose PR is still OPEN on GitHub must not regain merge authority); the reclaim self-resume preserves the refresh continuation as sidecars under the new token (`_publish_fresh` strips view keys from the base payload and republishes `refresh` + `refresh.attempted`); dead-marker completion is ground-truth-gated to `open` OR `merged` (r1's open-only gate would refuse a post-merge reclaimer crash mid-continuation and let another lane acquire — the r2 correction of an r1 fix; the residual stale-head window is bounded by the land driver's step-(ii) re-verification, U-HE-23); `_rate_check` validates lane_id containment (a path-escaping lane id would relocate the attempts store — the non-kill of the first containment probe was itself a finding: the weak witness accepted any downstream LeaseError, and the probe run leaked /tmp/evil, cleaned) and records-then-counts (threshold `> RATE_K`) so a concurrent burst cannot under-count a not-yet-recorded peer (the limiter bounds sustained rates; the LEASE CAS is the safety fence); `gc()` never follows attempts symlinks (a planted `attempts/<lane>` symlink could delete files outside QUEUE_DIR) and tolerates concurrent-collector `FileNotFoundError` per the log-and-yield idiom. 15 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(ix) Round-3 corrections (codex r3, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* `unblock()` mints a REPLACEMENT lease for the named lane (the door typically blocks DURING the §4(vii)–(viii) continuation, when the reservation reads `merged` and `acquire()` refuses — clearing without a successor stranded the continuation behind an unacquirable door; the continuation sidecars carry over, a lane wanting the door free releases the successor normally, and `complete_dead_marker` completes dead unblock markers exactly like reclaim ones); the reclaim reservation gate reads the PERSISTED `reservation_id` (a caller keeping the valid token but substituting another active arc's id bypassed the terminated-arc refusal); `gc()` also refuses a planted symlink at `attempts/` ITSELF (the r2 fix covered only per-lane symlinks — its ordinary-looking children passed the lane check while living outside QUEUE_DIR; the guard is restructured `if att.is_symlink(): att = None` for deletion-expressibility); `acquire()` re-validates the reservation AFTER the exclusive create (the pre-check and publish are separate operations — a concurrent reconciliation terminalizing in between left a live lease on a terminal arc; on divergence the fresh lease self-releases through the marker discipline, never a path-only unlink); `_move_lease` re-stamps the history file's mtime (rename preserved the ACQUISITION mtime, so a >30 d-blocked lease was GC-eligible the moment its transition completed — the retention clock now starts at the transition). Second non-kill finding: the r3 post-publication re-validation made the P2 PRE-check redundant to its witness (both raise HolderInvariant) — the witness now discriminates by asserting the pre-check path never publishes (no self-heal `released.*` artifact), same one-enforcement-point discipline as the r1 lane-id non-kill. 18 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(x) Round-4 corrections (codex r4, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* `_publish_fresh` publishes SIDECARS FIRST, LEASE LAST (a crash between a published LEASE and its not-yet-republished sidecars presented an apparently-refresh-free lease — a later self-resume would lose then re-issue the recorded refresh/attempt state; token-named sidecars ahead of their LEASE are invisible orphans, so the order is crash-safe both ways; the refresh-sidecar publisher is hoisted to `_publish_refresh_sidecars` for probe deletion-expressibility); `acquire()` cross-checks its inputs against the reservation's back-filled merge tuple (C-HE-03 §3 — unrelated caller inputs or a not-yet-back-filled reservation refuse; the reservation-to-lease authority link); `unblock` accepts the REFRESH continuation's PR as its key too (a §4(viii) refresh-CI block records the refresh PR, and the documented recovery command passes that number — the lease-pr-only key always mismatched); `_rate_check` mirrors gc's parent-symlink refusal on the WRITE path (a planted `attempts` symlink must not receive attempt files or lend rate authority); the marker action set is CLOSED at both ends (`win_marker` refuses unknown actions; `complete_dead_marker` fails closed on a malformed persisted marker instead of archiving a live lease as a pseudo-reclaim); `_move_lease` re-stamps the token's SIDECARS alongside the history file (same r3 P3 retention clock). *HELD (r4 P1a, plan-documented design):* the reclaim/unblock move→publish window transiently exposes an empty door — POSIX offers no two-name atomic swap; the landed design is the documented fail-loud + caller-re-gate (`lost the door` — witnessed by `test_reclaim_never_adopts_a_foreign_lease`), and an acquirer that slips in holds a VALID lease for its own arc (per-arc serialization is the reservation holder invariant, not the door's emptiness). 23 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xi) Round-5 corrections (codex r5, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* `complete_dead_marker` serializes concurrent completers on an exclusive-create `completed.<token>` claim (two callers could both validate the old token — the loser's rename after a foreign acquire would strip the NEW holder's live fence; the claim is taken after the cheap refusals so a refused completion stays retryable, and gc ages `completed.*` with the history); `unblock` re-checks the linked reservation exactly like reclaim (a blocked-then-abandoned arc could regain merge authority); `gc` refuses a symlinked `merge-door` DIR itself (`is_dir()` follows links — a planted QUEUE_DIR/merge-door symlink could delete history outside QUEUE_DIR); `_rate_check` refuses a symlinked `attempts/<lane>` too (`mkdir(exist_ok=True)` follows a symlink-to-dir silently). *HELD (r5 P1a re-raise of the r4-held move→publish window):* unchanged adjudication — POSIX has no two-name atomic swap; fail-loud + caller-re-gate is the plan-documented design and per-arc serialization rests on the reservation holder invariant. 27 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xii) Round-6 corrections (codex r6, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* the PRODUCTION `pending→open` flip lands in ship-pr's final-gate block (`reservations.py transition --to open` after the attested-tuple back-fill, pre-acquire — wiring the v1.4 X4a sentence into its carrier; the reviewer correctly held that the spec wording alone left normal arcs failing `acquire()`'s HolderInvariant with only the test fixture's `open_with_sensor` masking it; the CLI transition skips the `derived`-optional §7 sensor; skip clauses for unreserved/already-open passes; witnessed by the wiring witness's new needle); `_check_door()` refuses a symlinked `merge-door` root on EVERY write path (rate store, markers, sidecars — gc's read-side guard alone left the writers following the link); `complete_dead_marker` BREAKS a provably-dead claimant's completion claim (a completer dying between claim and act would have stranded completion forever — same poison-pill logic as the marker; the next pass completes); the `completed.<token>` family is filed in the C-HE-30 store audit (sole carrier of the completion-claim fact; the audit's literal-coverage test caught the omission deterministically). 29 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xiii) Round-7 corrections (codex r7, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* the dead-claimant claim break is an ADJUDICATE-AFTER-RENAME CAS (read-dead-then-unlink-by-path let a second breaker unlink a freshly recreated LIVE claim; the rename is the atomic single-winner, the moved bytes are the adjudicated evidence, a displaced live claim is restored via `os.link` which yields politely to any newer claim; the `.completed.<token>.broken.*` aside is filed in the audit's ephemeral table); gc retires a `transition.<token>` marker STRICTLY BEFORE its `completed.<token>` tombstone (pass-start marker snapshot — same-pass iterdir order or a mid-pass crash could leave the dead marker executable with its tombstone gone: stale-authority resurrection; the tombstone goes on the next pass); the attempts junk-sweep tolerates a concurrent cleaner's `FileNotFoundError` (log-and-yield). 31 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xiv) Round-8 corrections (codex r8, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* a `_retract_if_terminal` post-publish re-check lands at ALL THREE successor-publishing sites (reclaim / unblock / dead-marker completion) — the reservation gate is check-then-act, so an arc terminalized between `rs.current()` and the successor publish now self-releases through the marker discipline instead of standing with restored authority (the mirror of acquire's r3 post-publication re-validation); the claim-break gains a LIVE-PRE-READ gate before the r7 rename-CAS (renaming a believed-live claim would blank the pathname and admit a third concurrent completer; only a read-dead claim enters the rename, whose moved bytes are then re-adjudicated); `complete_dead_marker` gains the containment preamble (`_check_door()` + symlink refusal + DOOR-parent resolve + `transition.` name check — a planted symlink named like a marker could move the current LEASE without a legitimate `win_marker` publication). 33 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xv) Terminal round (codex r9–r10 — register-and-hold at the 10-round cap):* absorbed — the §7 Contract sentence aligned to the v1.4 X4a acquisition-scoped reading (the change-note's Invariants edit had left the same contradiction at its second carrier); `refresh.attempted` filed in the audit's sidecar family; an uncompleted completion claim is RELINQUISHED (a live completer's retained claim after a lost publish would refuse every later pass until process turnover — and the reservation-gate early-return that bypassed the relinquish tail was itself caught by the new witness assertion); a parseable-but-malformed marker (missing keys / non-integer pid) refuses fail-closed instead of aborting reconciliation. HELD classes at terminal (adjudication to the 3-lens merge gate): (a) the move→publish empty-door window — 5th raise; POSIX two-name-swap limit, plan-documented fail-loud + caller-re-gate, per-arc serialization rests on the reservation holder invariant; (b) the completion-claim break ABA chain (r5→r7→r8→r10 — each hardening narrows the interleaving that defeats it; the residual is a THREE-actor recovery-path-only race, bounded in production by the arc-serial door-reconcile venue, and the hardening sequence exhibits the workspace's documented non-convergent adversarial-hardening arms race — further rounds trade one interleaving for another); (c) symlink-swap TOCTOU between the containment checks and path use — closing it requires dirfd/O_NOFOLLOW filesystem plumbing across every store writer, a REGISTERED design candidate for the U-HE-23 landing (which owns the door's remaining I/O surface), not an incremental guard; (d) the sequential marker-race witness — the REAL concurrency witnesses for the door are U-HE-23's AC#2(c) subprocess crash-resume suite per the plan's own Step-1 (second half), where the marker race is exercised cross-process. 34 probes PINNED, coverage 0.* *(xvi) Merge-gate round 1 (PR #1413; concurrency BLOCK + witness BLOCK + spec APPROVE), each fix witnessed:* `_move_lease` re-stamps the SOURCE (LEASE + sidecars) BEFORE the rename, so the history record is BORN with the fresh transition-time mtime — the r3/r4 re-stamp fix had itself opened a rename→utime window in which a concurrent gc() could stat a >30d-stale dest and unlink the record early, plus an unguarded FileNotFoundError (concurrency P2; sidecars are stamped while the live-lease guard still protects them); the cross-host liveness branch is now WITNESSED at all its surfaces (witness P2: every prior fixture set host=gethostname(), so collapsing the host-mismatch OR-clause to pid-only liveness — a split-brain enabler — passed all 44 tests; `_forge_holder` forges a foreign host at the lease, the marker, and the claim). REGISTERED (concurrency P3 → U-HE-23, which owns the door's driver flow): `mark_blocked` publishes outside the transition-marker namespace, so a block landing between release/reclaim's persisted-state read and its `win_marker` is silently overridden — a post-win re-verify would brick the one-shot token on refusal, so the fix belongs in the driver's ordering (or a marker-namespace-aware blocked publication), not an incremental guard here. 35 probes PINNED, coverage 0.*

### U-HE-23: Merge-door landing steps (ii)–(ix), reconcile, `MERGE_DOOR_TEST_KILL_AFTER`, caller backoff policy, gate rows, attestation + cross-carrier `NOTIFY`

**Scope.** Add the landing driver `land(pr, …)`: verify head/base against `gh`, `local-base-cas-check` (`git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main <head_sha>` byte-equal to the reservation's `attested_merge_tree`), `mark_attempted` before a bounded 120 s `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --match-head-commit <head_sha>`, confirm via `gh pr view`, flip the reservation to `merged`, hold the lease through the merge SHA's own `main` run (45 min) and drive the terminating refresh as a continuation under the same lease (45 min), release; timeout/crash reconciliation that never re-issues after MERGED and re-issues at most once per pass on OPEN; the caller's backoff+jitter policy; the §9 gate rows as C-HE-24 findings; attestation-tier and cross-carrier `NOTIFY`s; CI queue-depth `NOTIFY`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-06 §1 (acquire before construct), §4 (steps i–ix; CI concurrency NOTIFY), §5 (reconcile), §8 (caller policy: yield + numbers), §9 (gate rows), §10 (tiering + cross-carrier), Invariants (never re-invoke after MERGED; `merge_attempted_at` before first byte); C-HE-19 §2 (`ci_is_green`; CANCELLED blocks the door); C-HE-03 §4 (`open→merged` on confirmed merge); C-HE-12 §2 (`BASE_TOCTOU` first-parent check emitted here after merge — the detection code lands in U-HE-33; this unit calls the hook if present).

**Files.** Modify `tools/merge_door.py`, `tools/test_merge_door.py`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

**Interfaces.**

(`TOOLS = Path(__file__).resolve().parent`; the CLI's `land` self-resumes when it finds this lane's lease with a dead pid — `reclaim(..., ground_state=reconcile(...))` — and prints `nothing to land` + exits 0 when no lease exists and the reservation is already `merged`.)
- [ ] **Step 2: AC#2(c) harness** — the `_fake_gh` shim + parametrized crash-resume test above are the complete body (no prose stand-in): four kill points, rc 137 asserted on the killed run, rc 0 on the resume, `merge-calls.log` line count == 1 in every case, lease state asserted per kill point.

**Rev 2026-08-21 (U-HE-23 execution corrections, as-built — landing half).** *(i) Per-PR FakeGround:* the sketch's single shared state dict made `gh_view(1)` report the REFRESH PR's state once the continuation began, breaking every resume assertion; the as-built fake keys state by pr (`states[1]`, `add_refresh_pr()` mints `states[2]`). *(ii) Sha value domains:* the sketch's `"h"/"t"/"m" * 40` literals fail the landed C-HE-03 §3 hex validation at `update_payload` (head/base/attested/merge_sha are `_SHA_FIELDS`); as-built uses `a/b/d/c * 40`. *(iii) `_notify` tolerant ledger wrapper:* the §3 order ships `loop_log_structured` at U-HE-29 while the roadmap executes U-HE-23 first (the registered §0-vs-§1 ordering contradiction, now biting a third unit) — `rs.emit_loop_row` raises `LoopStatusWriteError` today, and a missing ledger writer must never mask a `DoorBlocked` or crash the driver mid-landing; pre-U-HE-29 the signal degrades to a LOUD stderr line (in-band, never silent), durable rows arrive with U-HE-29. *(iv) Gate-row identity:* `make_finding_id` must hash the row's OWN `location` field (the sketch hashed the gate name and failed C-HE-24 §4 validation) and `n` is the count of the producer's prior rows for the head (the sketch's fixed 0 collided on a second same-head emission — main-CI row then refresh-CI row — and tripped the same-core invariant). *(v) Naming:* the driver's §5 reconciliation is `reconcile_ground()` (the module-neighbor `reservations.reconcile` is a different §5; one name per concept). *(vi) CLI self-resume guard:* reclaim fires only for a SAME-lane, SAME-pr lease whose holder is provably dead on this host and NOT blocked (a blocked door routes to unblock); merged-reservation-with-no-lease prints `nothing to land` rc 0. *(vii) gh/git shim:* one `pr view` case (the sketch's two JSON-field-keyed cases were the same string), `run list` non-`--commit` fallback `[]`. *(viii) Round-1 codex corrections (7 P2, each witnessed + probe-pinned):* `reconcile_ground` FAILS CLOSED on a non-OPEN/MERGED state (CLOSED/malformed was read as permission to re-issue); `_merge_once` takes a re-issue `budget` and every RESUME pass gets 1 (an attempted-marker restart could issue two more merges against the §5 single-re-issue contract — wired at both the main and refresh legs); a `refresh.intent` sidecar is published BEFORE `refresh()` runs, and intent-without-record BLOCKS to HITL (a crash between creating the refresh PR and persisting its identity would otherwise mint a second terminating-refresh PR on resume); a RESUMED recorded refresh reconciles ground truth before any merge call (a landed refresh was re-issued through `_merge_once`'s internal loop); `tier-clean-cycles` gets the same symlink containment as every door subdir; the CLI self-resume additionally requires `reservation_id == --arc-id` (a wrong arc argument could transition an unrelated reservation to merged); and the CLI's fresh-acquisition path routes through `wait_for_door` so the §8 backoff/budget policy IS the production path (BudgetExhausted exit 5 reachable), not an isolated unit.* *(ix) Round-2 codex corrections (4 P2 + 1 P3, each witnessed):* the `refresh.intent` fence SURVIVES a reclaim's token change (`read_lease` surfaces `refresh_intent`, `_publish_fresh` republishes the sidecar under the new token — the token-keyed fence was silently lost on self-resume, reopening the second-refresh-PR hole the r1 fix closed); the CLI routes NORMAL contention (a live foreign lease) through `wait_for_door` too (r1's wiring only covered the no-lease case, so real contention still exited 4 fail-fast); `BudgetExhausted` emits the §9 gate row + `DEFERRED-HIL` signal before exit 5 (a wedged door is human-actionable state, never only a stderr line); 38 fixture-generated synthetic rows (pr-1 / dummy-sha findings accumulated by suite runs BEFORE the hermetic gate-log seam landed) are PURGED from the tracked `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl` (consistency reducer clean after); `_tiering_active` treats a planted symlink as ACTIVE (a link to a ≥3-entry dir would have suppressed the §10 notifications). The CLI-contention witness runs `md.main` in-process against a patched `default_ground`, with the rate limiter disabled (real-clock RateLimited refusals never count against the budget and would loop forever at K=5/60s).*

### U-HE-24: `ci.yml` concurrency keyed by SHA for `main` pushes

**Scope.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:43-45` → group `ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.sha || github.ref }}`; PR-event semantics unchanged; the tradeoff comment stated inline.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-06 §4 "CI concurrency" (must key by SHA for `main` pushes; tradeoff: cancel-in-progress disabled for `main` runs; NOTIFY when > 2 in progress — emitted by U-HE-23).

**Files.** Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml:43-45`; add `tools/test_ci_yml_concurrency.py`.

**Depends on.** (none) — but MUST land before any N ≥ 2 landing (a sibling lane's push would cancel the run step (vii) waits on).

- [ ] **Step 1: Test**
```python
import yaml
from pathlib import Path
def test_main_push_concurrency_keyed_by_sha():
    ci = yaml.safe_load(Path(".github/workflows/ci.yml").read_text())
    group = ci["concurrency"]["group"]
    assert "github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.sha || github.ref" in group
    assert ci["concurrency"]["cancel-in-progress"] is True
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Edit**
```yaml
# Cancel superseded runs on the same ref so a fast push series doesn't queue -- EXCEPT on
# `main`, where the group is keyed by SHA: the merge door (C-HE-06 §4(vii)) holds its lease
# until the merge commit's OWN post-merge run is `success`, and lane B's landing must not
# cancel lane A's run. Tradeoff (stated): cancel-in-progress is effectively off for main
# pushes; under N-lane cadence full runs can queue -- the door emits a NOTIFY when > 2 are
# in progress.
concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.sha || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**, add the test to `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`; commit `ci(he-lanes): U-HE-24 key main-push concurrency by SHA (C-HE-06 §4)`.

### U-HE-25: `tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh` + guard deny-raw / allow-wrapper + test inversion

**Scope.** Create the allowlisted wrapper (exact arity `bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh <pr>`; performs C-HE-06 (i)–(ix) by delegating to `merge_door.py land`); deny raw `gh pr merge` in loop mode as an explicit `emit_deny`; allow only the wrapper next to `_safe_worktree_remove_wrapper`; invert the two guard tests that assert `gh pr merge → allow`. **Registered from U-HE-21 (codex r1–r6 on that PR; this is the reviewed guard-modification unit):** the same guard edit also allowlists the U-HE-21 carrier commands, EXACT-SHAPE only (codex r6 P2 ×2 narrowed both matchers) — (a) `uv run python tools/reservations.py <verb>` for the carrier verbs `selectable|show|reserve|update|mint-lane-id` ONLY — never the bare module prefix, which would auto-approve `transition` (terminal state changes), `gc` (history pruning), and `reconcile`/`reconcile-all` (gh-backed; hook-invoked, not Bash-tool-invoked, so it needs no allowlisting); (b) a leading env-prefix strip restricted to exactly `HARNESS_ARC_ID=` and `HARNESS_LANE_ID=` with bareword values (no `$`/quotes/spaces) — never the generic `HARNESS_[A-Z0-9_]+` class, which would let `HARNESS_FAILOVER_CHILD=1 just gemini-review` silently skip reservation-outcome persistence; (c) `git merge-tree` in the read-arc git verb group — each with allow + hardening cases in `test_permission_guard.sh` (the U-HE-21 witness already pins the never-denied floor for these shapes and the allow floor for the bare `just review-with-failover` headless fallback).

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-07 §1 (matcher verbatim), §2 (deny in the deny block; allow beside `:288-290`), §3 (test inversion `:167-169`, `:328-329`), §4, Invariants (`--admin` stays denied `:397`).

**Files.** Create `tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh`. Modify `tools/hooks/permission-guard.sh` (`:184-191` add `_safe_merge_wrapper`; `:288-290` allow; `:314-340` deny), `tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh:167-169, 328-329` (+ new cases).

**Depends on.** U-HE-23.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests** (`tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh`; replace the two `gh pr merge → allow` assertions):
```bash
# C-HE-07: raw merge verb DENIED in loop mode; only the safe-merge wrapper is auto-allowed.
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'gh pr merge 268 --squash --delete-branch' '')")
[ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "raw gh pr merge → deny (loop mode)" || bad "raw merge not denied: $OUT"
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'gh pr merge 1 --squash' '')")
[ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "raw gh pr merge --squash → deny" || bad "raw merge --squash not denied: $OUT"
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh 268' '')")
[ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "allow" ] && ok "safe-merge wrapper → allow" || bad "wrapper not allowed: $OUT"
for c in 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh 268 --squash' 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh $PR' 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh 268; rm x' 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh abc' 'tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh'; do
  OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash "$c" '')")
  [ "$(dec "$OUT")" != "allow" ] && ok "wrapper hardening: '$c' → not allow" || bad "wrapper over-matched: $c"
done
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'gh pr merge 5 --admin' '')")
[ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "--admin merge stays denied" || bad "--admin merge not denied: $OUT"
grep -q 'raw gh pr merge' "$REPO/.harness/loop_status.md" 2>/dev/null || true   # DENY row audited via emit_deny (venue per U-HE-29)
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Implement.** In `permission-guard.sh` after `_safe_worktree_remove_wrapper` (`:184-191`) add the reference matcher verbatim from C-HE-07 §1:
```bash
_safe_merge_wrapper() {
  local cmd="$1"
  printf '%s' "$cmd" | grep -q '[;&|<>`\\()]' && return 1
  [[ "$cmd" == *$'\n'* ]] && return 1
  printf '%s' "$cmd" | grep -Eq '(~|\.\.|\$\{?[A-Za-z_])' && return 1
  set -f; set -- $cmd; set +f
  if [ "${1:-}" = "bash" ]; then shift; fi
  [ "$#" -eq 2 ] && [ "$1" = "tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh" ] || return 1
  case "$2" in ''|*[!0-9]*) return 1 ;; esac
  return 0
}
```
After the `_safe_worktree_remove_wrapper` allow (`:288-290`):
```bash
if [ "$TOOL" = "Bash" ] && [ -n "$CMD" ] && _safe_merge_wrapper "$CMD"; then
  emit_allow
fi
```
In the deny block (`:314-340`), after the branch-deletion deny:
```bash
  # C-HE-07: the merge verb goes through the lease-holding wrapper ONLY (structural fence, P1).
  printf '%s' "$CMD" | grep -Eq '(^|[[:space:]])gh[[:space:]]+pr[[:space:]]+merge([[:space:]]|$)' \
    && emit_deny "raw gh pr merge — must go through tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh"
```
and remove `merge` from the `gh pr (…)` allow alternation at `:427` (`view|list|checks|diff|status|create|ready|comment`). Create `tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# C-HE-07 allowlisted merge wrapper. Exact arity: `bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh <pr-number>`.
# Performs C-HE-06 steps (i)-(ix) by delegating to tools/merge_door.py; the ONLY merge string it
# ever issues is `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --match-head-commit <head_sha>` (inside merge_door).
# No flags are accepted or forwarded.
set -euo pipefail
[ "$#" -eq 1 ] || { echo "usage: safe-merge.sh <pr-number>" >&2; exit 64; }
case "$1" in ''|*[!0-9]*) echo "safe-merge: pr must be all digits" >&2; exit 64 ;; esac
: "${HARNESS_LANE_ID:?HARNESS_LANE_ID must be set (lane-init)}"
: "${HARNESS_ARC_ID:?HARNESS_ARC_ID must be set (roadmap-continue arc open)}"
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
exec uv run python tools/merge_door.py land "$1" --lane-id "$HARNESS_LANE_ID" --arc-id "$HARNESS_ARC_ID" \
  --refresh-cmd "uv run python tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py --emit-refresh-pr-json"
```
(`--emit-refresh-pr-json` is the existing refresh tool's new flag that creates — idempotently, by branch name — the terminating refresh PR and prints `{"pr": N, "head_sha": "..."}` — add it in U-HE-28.)
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN** — `bash tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh` all `ok`. Register `Row("C-HE-07", "shell:tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", False)`. Commit:
```bash
git add tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh tools/hooks/permission-guard.sh tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh tools/lanes_verify.py
git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-25 safe-merge wrapper + deny raw gh pr merge / allow wrapper (C-HE-07)"
```

### U-HE-26: Push-to-`main` client-side `emit_deny` predicates

**Scope.** Explicit `emit_deny` entries in the deny block for any push whose refspec/upstream targets `main` (incl. bare `git push` while `main` is checked out); topic-branch pushes remain auto-allowed.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-08 §1 (predicates verbatim; in the deny block, not the allow regex, so `loop_log DENY` audits it), Invariants.

**Files.** Modify `tools/hooks/permission-guard.sh:321-329` (append), `tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh`.

**Depends on.** (none).

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests**
```bash
# C-HE-08 §1: push-to-main denied; topic pushes still allowed
for c in 'git push origin HEAD:main' 'git push origin main' 'git push origin refs/heads/main' 'git push -u origin feature:main' 'git push --set-upstream origin main' 'git push origin feature main' 'git push --force-with-lease=x origin +feature:refs/heads/main' "git push origin 'HEAD:main'" 'git push origin "main"'; do
  OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash "$c" '')"); [ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "'$c' → deny" || bad "push-to-main not denied: $c → $OUT"
done
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'git push origin feature' '')"); [ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "allow" ] && ok "topic push → allow" || bad "topic push blocked: $OUT"
# bare `git push` while main is checked out
( cd "$REPO" && git init -q . && git checkout -q -b main 2>/dev/null; git commit -q --allow-empty -m i )
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'git push' '')"); [ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "bare push on main checkout → deny" || bad "bare push on main not denied: $OUT"
OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'git push -u origin' '')"); [ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "deny" ] && ok "option-bearing bare push on main → deny" || bad "-u origin on main not denied: $OUT"
( cd "$REPO" && git checkout -q -b topic ); OUT=$(run_on "$(pl Bash 'git push' '')"); [ "$(dec "$OUT")" = "allow" ] && ok "bare push on topic → allow" || bad "bare push on topic blocked: $OUT"
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Implement** (deny block, after the branch-deletion deny):
```bash
  # C-HE-08 §1 (D5): no auto-approved push lands content on main. Explicit denies (audited via loop_log DENY),
  # NOT a removal from the allow regex (that would be the silent, unaudited "ask" path). The spec's reference
  # regexes (C10) consumed at most one token between `push` and the refspec and therefore ALLOWED
  # `git push -u origin feature:main` (Codex round-2 P1); this parses the argument list instead: option tokens
  # (`-*`) anywhere are skipped, positionals are [remote] [refspec...], and any refspec whose destination is
  # main -- `main`, `HEAD:main`, `X:main`, `refs/heads/main` -- or a push with NO refspec while main is checked
  # out, is denied.
  if printf '%s' "$CMD" | grep -Eq '^[[:space:]]*git[[:space:]]+push([[:space:]]|$)' && _push_targets_main "$CMD"; then
    emit_deny "push targeting main — land through a PR + tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh"
  fi
```
with the parser placed beside `_safe_merge_wrapper`:
```bash
# 0 iff the push command targets main: any refspec destination == main, or no refspec while main is checked out.
_push_targets_main() {
  local cmd="$1" tok positional=() dest branch
  set -f; set -- $cmd; set +f
  shift 2                                   # git push
  for tok in "$@"; do
    tok=${tok//\"/}; tok=${tok//\'/}         # the real shell strips quotes: `'HEAD:main'` IS HEAD:main (Codex round-4 P1)
    case "$tok" in -*) continue ;; esac     # options anywhere (-u, --set-upstream, --force-with-lease=..., ...)
    positional+=("$tok")
  done
  if [ "${#positional[@]}" -le 1 ]; then    # bare push (optional remote only) -> pushes the current branch
    branch=$(git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" symbolic-ref --short -q HEAD 2>/dev/null)
    [ "$branch" = "main" ] && return 0
    return 1
  fi
  for tok in "${positional[@]:1}"; do       # every refspec after the remote
    dest="${tok##*:}"; dest="${dest#+}"; dest="${dest#refs/heads/}"
    [ "$dest" = "main" ] && return 0
  done
  return 1
}
```
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**, probe (`--lines` = the first predicate) → PINNED. Register `Row("C-HE-08", "shell:tools/hooks/test_permission_guard.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`. Commit `feat(he-lanes): U-HE-26 deny push-to-main predicates in the audited deny block (C-HE-08 §1)`.

### U-HE-27: `tools/main_protection.py` + `just main-protection-{show,apply,rollback,tiebreaker,verify}`

**Scope.** Server-side X9 fence as recipes: `show` (read-only GET), `apply` (embeds the exact JSON payload; re-derives the "— blocking" context list from `ci.yml` job `name:` values; prints one before/after diff; run by Claude OUTSIDE loop mode; the operator answers one AskUserQuestion), `rollback` (`gh api -X DELETE …/protection`, with the pre-change `show` recorded in the evidence log), `tiebreaker` (scratch PR merge under `strict:true` + a refresh PR branched from a since-superseded `main` fast-forwards or is caught pre-merge), `verify` (read-only exact-compare of every required setting + context; 404/mismatch → RED; auth-absent → skip reason `gh-auth-absent`, which `lanes-phase0-check` counts as RED).

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-08 §2 (exact settings; recipes; `enforce_admins:true` does not block the refresh merge), §3 (operator-gated), §4 (tiebreaker), §5 (`verify` phase0 row, runs local); §11 #2.

**Files.** Create `tools/main_protection.py`, `tools/test_main_protection.py`. Modify `justfile` (five recipes), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

**Interfaces.**
```python
REQUIRED = {"required_pull_request_reviews": None, "enforce_admins": True, "allow_force_pushes": False, "allow_deletions": False, "required_linear_history": False}
def blocking_contexts(ci_yml: Path = REPO/".github/workflows/ci.yml") -> list[str]   # job `name:` values ending "— blocking", workflow "CI"

def verify(current: dict | None, desired: dict) -> list[str]     # mismatches; [] = pass

 `tiebreaker`: creates branch `mp-tiebreaker-<ts>` with one empty commit → PR → `gh pr merge --squash --match-head-commit` (through `merge_door` is NOT required here — this is the operator-gated live probe, run outside loop mode) → then creates a second branch from the pre-merge `main` SHA, opens a "refresh-shaped" PR, and asserts `gh pr view --json mergeStateStatus` reports `BEHIND`/`BLOCKED` (caught pre-merge) or the merge fast-forwards cleanly; prints PASS/FAIL and the evidence lines. Recipes:
```make
# ─── C-HE-08 branch protection for main (server-side X9 fence; operator-gated apply) ──────
main-protection-show:
    uv run python tools/main_protection.py show
# `apply` shows the diff and MUTATES NOTHING; the operator approves the actual payload (AskUserQuestion), then
# `apply-confirm` performs the provisional apply + tiebreaker (+ automatic rollback on FAIL). Never hard-code --confirm.
main-protection-apply:
    uv run python tools/main_protection.py apply
main-protection-apply-confirm:

main-protection-rollback:

main-protection-tiebreaker:

```
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN** unit tests; register `Row("C-HE-08", "just:main-protection-verify", "phase0", "local", False, ("gh-auth-absent",))` and `Row("C-HE-08", "live:main-protection-tiebreaker + apply (operator-gated; evidence log)", "operator-gated", "loop, live", False)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: The operator gate (the ONE decision this unit surfaces).** Run `just main-protection-show` (expect 404 today) and `just main-protection-apply` **outside loop mode** — it prints the diff and mutates nothing (exit 3); Claude then asks one AskUserQuestion: *"Apply branch protection to `main` now? [the printed diff]"*; on approval `just main-protection-apply-confirm` applies **provisionally, runs the tiebreaker in a throwaway worktree, and rolls back automatically on FAIL** (C-HE-08 §4: tiebreaker before enforcing). Then `just main-protection-verify` (must be GREEN before `lanes-phase0-check` can pass). Record `show` (pre), `apply` (post), tiebreaker PASS lines in `.harness/plan/evidence-log-he-loop-lanes.md` (created in U-HE-44).
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit** — `git add tools/main_protection.py tools/test_main_protection.py justfile tools/lanes_verify.py tools/codex-parity-check.sh && git commit -m "feat(he-lanes): U-HE-27 main branch-protection recipes + verify phase0 row (C-HE-08 §2-5)"`.

### U-HE-28: `just merge-door-unblock` + `ship-pr` merge-door steps + refresh continuation

**Scope.** Add the unblock recipe; rewrite `ship-pr`'s merge step to: acquire before constructing any merge command (`bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh <pr>` is the ONLY merge invocation), and remove its separate "open terminating refresh PR + merge" steps (the door does it as a continuation under the same lease); give `tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py` the `--emit-refresh-pr-json` flag the wrapper calls.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-06 §1, §4(viii), §6 (unblock only via recipe; never a path-only unlink), §8 (yield to next gate pass; `wait_for_door` numbers), C-HE-01 Invariants (§12.2.1 one-file refresh preserved).

**Files.** Modify `justfile`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md` (merge + refresh sections), `tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py` (flag), `tools/hooks/test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh` (extend greps).

**Depends on.** U-HE-23, U-HE-25.

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing test** (extend `test_skill_reservation_wiring.sh`):
```bash
grep -q 'bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh' "$SP" && ok "ship-pr merges through the wrapper" || bad "ship-pr lacks safe-merge"
grep -Eq '(^|[^`])gh pr merge' "$SP" && bad "ship-pr still carries a raw gh pr merge instruction" || ok "no raw merge verb in ship-pr"
grep -q 'merge-door-unblock' justfile && ok "unblock recipe present" || bad "no unblock recipe"
grep -q 'emit-refresh-pr-json' tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py && ok "refresh tool emits PR json" || bad "no --emit-refresh-pr-json"
```
- [ ] **Step 2: RED**; **Step 3: Implement.** Recipe:
```make
# C-HE-06 §6: clear a `blocked` merge-door lease -- operator-confirmed reclaim through the marker CAS,
# keyed to the blocked SHA. There is NO raw-unlink recipe by design.
merge-door-unblock pr sha:
    uv run python tools/merge_door.py unblock {{pr}} {{sha}} --lane-id "$HARNESS_LANE_ID"
merge-door-status:
    uv run python tools/merge_door.py status
```
`ship-pr/SKILL.md` merge section (replace the current `gh pr merge` + post-merge CI + refresh-PR steps):
> **Land through the merge door (C-HE-06/07).** After CI green + `merge-gate` all-APPROVE: `bash tools/hooks/safe-merge.sh <pr>`. This acquires the lease (fail-fast; on `held` it yields — do the next natural gate-pass, then retry; the wrapper's own `wait_for_door` applies base 30 s ×2 cap 10 min ×12 then routes `HITL-recoverable`), verifies head/base + `local-base-cas-check`, merges with the fixed string, confirms MERGED, flips the reservation, **holds the lease through the merge SHA's own `main` run and the terminating refresh PR as a continuation** (`.harness/roadmap_status.md`-only, §12.2.1 shape unchanged), then releases. Exit 0 = landed + refreshed; 3 = door blocked (a `DEFERRED-HIL` row names `just merge-door-unblock <pr> <sha>`); 4 = re-gate (base moved); 5 = budget exhausted (HITL). Never issue `gh pr merge` yourself; the guard denies it in loop mode.

`tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py --emit-refresh-pr-json`: performs the existing refresh (one-file shape enforced as today), commits on `roadmap-refresh-post-<pr>`, pushes, `gh pr create`, prints `{"pr": N, "head_sha": "<sha>"}` and exits 0; any failure exits non-zero with no JSON (the door then fails (viii) → blocked).

Add to `tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py` (after the existing refresh writes `.harness/roadmap_status.md`; the one-file shape check the tool already performs stays the gate):
```python
def emit_refresh_pr(post_pr: int, *, run=subprocess.run) -> dict:
    """C-HE-06 §4(viii): create the terminating refresh PR and print {pr, head_sha} for the merge door.

    pr = int(url.rstrip("/").rsplit("/", 1)[-1])
    return {"pr": pr, "head_sha": sh("git", "rev-parse", "HEAD")}
```
`main()`: `p.add_argument("--emit-refresh-pr-json", type=int, metavar="POST_PR")` → after the refresh, `print(json.dumps(emit_refresh_pr(args.emit_refresh_pr_json)))`. (The wrapper passes the landed PR number: `--refresh-cmd "uv run python tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py --emit-refresh-pr-json $1"` — update `safe-merge.sh` accordingly.)

- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**, register the shell row (already registered in U-HE-21). Commit `feat(he-lanes): U-HE-28 ship-pr lands through the door; refresh as continuation; unblock recipe (C-HE-06 §1/§4/§6)`.

# S4d — `loop_status` venue + coalescing + env isolation + emitting detections

### U-HE-29: `loop_status.md` shared venue, structured column, `NOTIFY` / `COALESCE-DELIVERED` kinds, ACTIVATE scoping, rendered `[lane_id]`, pointer sweep

**Scope.** `loop_status_path()` resolves to the shared venue `QUEUE_DIR/../loop_status.md` (default `~/.gstack/projects/arhugula-v2/loop_status.md`, override `HARNESS_LOOP_STATUS_PATH`) for every caller; control markers stay per-lane; every emitted row carries the structured column **before** detail (`lane=<lane_id>;cause=<cause|->`); reducers accept both shapes; the "since last ACTIVATE" reset is struck for HIL rows; `NOTIFY` is append-only, rendered beside (never merged into) the DEFERRED-HIL summary and excluded from the skip-set; `COALESCE-DELIVERED` kind declared; every literal `.harness/loop_status.md` pointer swept.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-09 §1 (single file), §2 (venue determinism; markers per-lane; pointer sweep list), §3 (row shape; rejoin defect; reducers key detail's first token; `[<lane_id>]` rendered), §4 (ACTIVATE option (b)), §5 (kinds), §6, Invariants; C-HE-20 §1 (NOTIFY for informational).

**Files.** Modify `tools/hooks/loop_lib.sh` (`:6`, `:24-27`, `:73-85`, `:127-157`, `:165-186`, `:191-231`), `tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh`, `tools/hooks/session-start.sh` (render NOTIFY beside HIL), `.claude/skills/loop-start/SKILL.md:16,34`, `.claude/skills/loop-stop/SKILL.md:23`, `.claude/skills/resolve/SKILL.md:15`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md:309`.

**Interfaces (bash).**
```bash
loop_status_path            # → ${HARNESS_LOOP_STATUS_PATH:-<dirname of QUEUE_DIR>/loop_status.md}
loop_log <kind> <detail...>            # now writes: | ts | kind | lane=${HARNESS_LANE_ID:--};cause=${LOOP_CAUSE:--} | detail |
loop_log_structured <kind> <lane_id> <cause_signature> <detail...>
loop_notify_summary                    # last 5 NOTIFY rows (24 h), one line, for SessionStart
_loop_row_detail_awk                   # shared awk prelude: detects structured vs legacy, sets d (detail), lane
```

**Depends on.** (none). (Precedes U-HE-18/23 emitters per the shape decision.)

- [ ] **Step 1: Failing tests** (`tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh` — the file's `ok/bad`, `loop_now` stub idioms; the harness now sets `export HARNESS_LOOP_STATUS_PATH="$REPO/shared/loop_status.md"` at the top instead of relying on `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`):

Shared awk prelude (a bash variable sourced into every reducer):

# and `lane` (or "-" for legacy 3-column rows).

`loop_skip_set` awk → `"$_LOOP_AWK_ROW"' { rowparse() } k == "DEFERRED-HIL" || k == "RESOLVED-HIL" { state[tok] = (k == "DEFERRED-HIL") ? "PENDING" : "RESOLVED" } END {...}'` — **the `k == "ACTIVATE" { delete state }` line is removed** (option (b)). `_loop_pending_hil_rows` → same prelude; `detail[tok] = "[" lane "] " d`; ACTIVATE reset removed. `loop_resolve`'s own-write grep matches `"| RESOLVED-HIL | lane=" ... "| ${escaped} |"` (build the exact structured row string the same way `loop_log_structured` does). Add:
```bash
# NOTIFY rows: append-only informational; rendered BESIDE the DEFERRED-HIL summary at SessionStart,
# never merged into it, never in the skip-set (C-HE-09 §5). Last 5 rows within 24 h.

}
```
`loop_pending_hil_summary`'s trailing text `See .harness/loop_status.md` → `See $(loop_status_path)`; header comment `:6` reworded; `session-start.sh` prints `loop_notify_summary` on its own line after the HIL summary. Pointer sweep: the four skill files' literals → *"the shared `loop_status.md` (`$(loop_status_path)`; default `~/.gstack/projects/arhugula-v2/loop_status.md`)"*.
- [ ] **Step 3b: write-failure test** (`test_loop_lib.sh`): `HARNESS_LOOP_STATUS_PATH=/nonexistent-dir/x.md loop_log_structured NOTIFY L1 a:b:c "detail"; [ $? -eq 1 ] && ok "structured write failure returns 1" || bad "..."`; and `loop_log NOTIFY x` under the same path returns 0 (hook contract preserved).
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN** (`bash tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh` + `test_permission_guard.sh` + `test_stop_gate.sh` etc. — every hook test that reads the ledger must set `HARNESS_LOOP_STATUS_PATH`; sweep with `rg 'loop_status_path|loop_status.md' tools/hooks/test_*.sh`). Probes: ACTIVATE reset (`--lines` cannot re-add a line — witness is the §4 test; record) and row shape (`--lines` = the `if ($4 ~ /^[ \t]*lane=/)` branch → structured rows mis-parse → RED) → PINNED. Register `Row("C-HE-09/10", "shell:tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh", "phase0", "local + CI", True)`.

### U-HE-30: Gate coalescing by `cause_signature`, 10 min window, pull-based delivery

**Scope.** `loop_pending_hil_summary()` / `loop_cap_list()` gain a second reduction key `cause_signature` (from the structured column): pending rows group by cause; a group is *delivered* (one batched prompt) only once `first_seen + window` (default 600 s, `HARNESS_HIL_COALESCE_WINDOW_S` in 300–900) has elapsed; delivery appends `| ts | COALESCE-DELIVERED | lane=<lane>;cause=<sig> | <generation-id> |`; rows already covered by a `COALESCE-DELIVERED` at/after their `first_seen` are treated as delivered so two SessionStart paths cannot both prompt.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-10 §1–§4; C-HE-09 §3, §5 (kind).

**Files.** Modify `tools/hooks/loop_lib.sh` (`loop_pending_hil_summary`, new `loop_hil_groups`, `loop_hil_deliver`), `tools/hooks/test_loop_lib.sh`, `tools/hooks/session-start.sh`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-11 §1 (Docker `-p`, full collision set, port formula, `k` allocation), §2 (`gc.auto 0` once), §4 (no per-lane uv cache), §5 (RAM probe → NOTIFY, never a `merge-door-`/`reservation-` cause).

**Files.** Create `tools/hooks/lane-init.sh`, `tools/hooks/test_lane_init.sh`, `tools/test_compose_lanes.py`. Modify `justfile:469-480`, `deploy/self-hosted-local/compose.yaml:12,24-25,41-42`, `tools/hooks/safe-worktree-remove.sh` (release `QUEUE_DIR/lanes/<k>` on disposal), `.claude/skills/two-lane/SKILL.md` (source lane-init).

### U-HE-32: git ref-lock bounded retry helper

**Scope.** `hook_git_retry <git args…>` in `tools/hooks/lib.sh`: on `index.lock`/`.lock: File exists` failures retry with `{base 100 ms, factor 2, cap 5 s, max 8}` + full jitter; exhaustion fails the git op and emits a `NOTIFY` (never the merge-door budget). Used by `lane-init.sh`, `safe-worktree-remove.sh`, and documented for skills.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-11 §3 (numbers; distinct from the lease's fail-fast).

**Files.** Modify `tools/hooks/lib.sh`, `tools/hooks/test_lib.sh`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-29.

- [ ] **Step 1: Test** (`test_lib.sh`): create `.git/index.lock` in a scratch repo, run `hook_git_retry add -A` in the background with the lock removed after 300 ms → succeeds after ≥ 2 attempts (count via `HOOK_GIT_RETRY_TRACE` file); with the lock held → exits non-zero after 8 attempts, a `NOTIFY` row with `cause=git-ref-lock:transient-retry:lock_contention` exists.

### U-HE-33: Emitting detections — `SPLIT_BRAIN_LEDGER`, `ORPHANED_RESERVATION`, `BASE_TOCTOU` + lane field + CI split-brain job

**Scope.** Three new codes in `codex_context_guard.py`, each emitted through the C-HE-24 record (with `lane_id`/`arc_id`) and projected to `Finding` for the CI surface: `SPLIT_BRAIN_LEDGER` (duplicate `arc_id` among `record_kind=arc` rows — CI backstop on every push to `main`), `ORPHANED_RESERVATION` (an `open` head whose PR is MERGED/CLOSED without a terminal transition, or a `blocked` lease older than its bound), `BASE_TOCTOU` (merge commit first parent ≠ verified base — the door emits it in U-HE-23; the guard re-checks the last N merges on `main`). Detection count ≥ 4/19.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-12 §1–§3; §9 rows 1, 4, 6, 7; C-HE-24 §6 (lane attribution); C-HE-25 (arc rows only).

**Files.** Modify `tools/codex_context_guard.py` (new checks + `--lane-id` field in `_json_report`), `tools/test_codex_context_guard.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (job `split-brain`), `tools/lanes_verify.py`.

# S5 — Phase timing as explicit spans

### U-HE-34: Phase spans — durable accretion, `result_capture` split, N6 formula, no-delta static witness

**Scope.** Every phase `queue / execute / capture / absorb / edit / verify` recorded as an explicit `{start, end}` (accreting on the reservation during the open window via `record_phase` — U-HE-17 — and folded into the arc row at drain — U-HE-19); `result_capture` records process-exit and log-write-completion separately; the emitters (`roadmap-continue`, `ship-pr`, `tools/hooks/*`) call `reservations.py phase`; N6 = COUNT(DISTINCT `finding_id` with last disposition `accepted`) ÷ Σ(`phases.verify` + `phases.edit`) hours with `REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE` rounds excluded from the denominator; a static test that no metrics reader derives a duration from the gap between two records.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-27 §1 (phases; result_capture split), §2 (never inter-record delta), §3 (durable spans on the reservation; fold at drain), §4 (N6 definition + `verify_unavailable_s` exclusion); C-HE-25 (`phases` on the row); §11 #5 (plan S5 decides audit-worthiness of a `result_capture` divergence — **decision: recorded, not audit-worthy in v1**; both timestamps land on the row, no finding is emitted on divergence; a forward-register row carries the question).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`n6(rows, gate_rows)`, `phase_spans(row)`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`, `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md`, `tools/hooks/stop-gate.sh` (or the hook that observes process exit vs log write — the executor greps `REVIEW-.*log` writers in `tools/hooks/` and instruments the two timestamps at the site the file already logs).

# S6 — Reviewer-concurrency probe → coalescing live → pilot gate + pilots + O1 + O3 / `arc_disjoint_check` + cohort report

### U-HE-35: `tools/reviewer_concurrency_probe.py`

**Scope.** Live probe: ≥ 5 repetitions at each of {1, 2, 4} concurrent `codex-review` / `gemini-review` invocations against one fixed diff; records verdict validity (C-HE-15) and per-call wall-clock as C-HE-24 rows (`producer=reviewer_concurrency_probe`); GREEN iff median wall-clock at N ≤ 2 × the N=1 median AND zero validity failures — either violation ⇒ RED, throttling assumed present, pilots do not start.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-22 §1–§2, Verification (≥ 5 reps; pass rule); C-HE-13 §2 (order: probe → coalescing → pilots); §11 #7.

**Files.** Create `tools/reviewer_concurrency_probe.py`, `tools/test_reviewer_concurrency_probe.py` (pass-rule unit on synthetic samples). Modify `justfile` (`reviewer-concurrency-probe`), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

### U-HE-36: `tools/arc_disjoint_check.py` + selection-time refusal

**Scope.** Prospective merge-tree check: before a lane opens an arc, compute `git merge-tree --write-tree` of the candidate head against every other lane's current head (from the `open` reservations' `branch`) and refuse selection on a non-empty conflict set; the O3 base-rate recipe (`--historical`) runs merge-tree over the 172 historical colliding pairs and reports the textual-conflict rate against the 38.7 % bound with the semantic rate reported as unmeasured.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-13 §4 (O3 + prospective; U-WT-07 named at `two-lane/SKILL.md:19`), §5 (scope hint, not gate; actual-write enforcement); §9 rows 10, 18.

**Files.** Create `tools/arc_disjoint_check.py`, `tools/test_arc_disjoint_check.py`. Modify `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md` (call before `reserve`), `.claude/skills/two-lane/SKILL.md:17-19` (scope = hint; check = gate), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

### U-HE-37: Pilot gate — `just lanes-pilot`, `lanes-pilot-report`, O1 recipe, pilot-runner unit

**Scope.** `just lanes-pilot <run-id>` refuses to start unless `just lanes-phase0-check` exits 0 (names the failing row), then prints the manual N-lane pilot recipe (spawn N lanes via `two-lane`, each `lane-init`, run to landing) and records `pilot_run_id` on each lane's reservation; `just lanes-pilot-report <run-id>` computes the §3 iff-clause across the three stores (every lane's arc `merged`, first-parent detection clean, union ledger satisfies C-HE-03/04 invariants, no HITL escalation with a `merge-door-`/`reservation-` cause) and prints PASS/FAIL + friction rows; "recurring" = a `cause_signature` in ≥ 2 of ≥ 3 pilots OR one operator-rated severe. O1 = the instrumented 4-worktree `hook_project_dir()` probe **after** U-HE-29 (a recipe line in the pilot script).

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-13 §1 (mechanical gate), §2 (order; O1 after X6 fix), §3 (≥ 3 pilots at 3–4 lanes gate follow-on orchestration only; success iff-clause; recurring definition); C-HE-06 §10 (attestation tiering during pilots — U-HE-23); §8 AC#1.

**Files.** Create `tools/lanes_pilot.py` (`gate()`, `report(run_id)`), `tools/test_lanes_pilot_gate.py`. Modify `justfile` (`lanes-pilot`, `lanes-pilot-report`), `.claude/skills/two-lane/SKILL.md:140-142` (pilot bar wording: gates follow-on orchestration only), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

### U-HE-38: Cohort report joint on `(concurrent_lanes_at_open, arc_type)`, drift join, correlational header

**Scope.** `summary` gains the joint stratification `(concurrent_lanes_at_open, arc_type_open)` with the existing exact-lever-set discipline; joins `ROADMAP_STATUS_DRIFT` findings (from `merge-gate-log.jsonl`, lane-attributed) by `lane_id`/`arc_id` and correlates incidence against `concurrent_lanes_at_open`; the report header carries the "correlational — assignment to N is operator-chosen; descriptive counts only until N ≥ 2 and `applying` cells populate" statement.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-28 §1–§3; C-HE-25; §8 AC#10; C-HE-26 §3 (EVALUATE gate: no routing-accuracy claim until ≥ 20 open-labeled arcs with both `arc_type` cells non-zero).

**Files.** Modify `tools/arc_metrics.py` (`summary`), `tools/test_arc_metrics.py`.

In `arc_metrics.py` (`GATE_LOG = REPO / ".harness" / "merge-gate-log.jsonl"` next to `LEDGER`; block appended to `summary()` after the lever cohorts):

### U-HE-39: Skill-carrier doc sweep — N ≥ 2 wording, blocked list, live-carrier cites, no round cap, non-goals, K5–K8

**Scope.** Bring the in-scope carriers to the spec's normative wording: `two-lane` + `roadmap-continue` state the model at N ≥ 2 without an N=2 literal cap and with the throughput qualifier "well under N×; prior, not measurement"; `two-lane` carries the C-HE-14 blocked/rejected table; `merge-gate` + `ship-pr` cite live carriers for #5/#14 and state #16 void and "no round cap"; Part D non-goals and the K5–K8 dispositions are recorded in `merge-gate`/`ship-pr` as non-goals; a grep witness asserts no numeric round cap in loop skills.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-01 §1–§4 + Verification; C-HE-14 (table); C-HE-21 §1–§4; C-HE-34; C-HE-35; §8 AC#7 (grep witness).

**Files.** Modify `.claude/skills/two-lane/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/roadmap-continue/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/merge-gate/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md`; create `tools/hooks/test_skill_lanes_docs.sh`.

# S7 — Mechanize classes → dedupe executions → local/CI gap (Layer 2)

### U-HE-40: `tools/mechanized_checks/` — seven classes + `just mech-check` + state file + promotion/demotion machine

**Scope.** A small framework (`Check` protocol, runner, C-HE-24 emission with `producer=<check_id>`, `.harness/mechanized-checks-state.json` runtime state) plus one module per self-inflicted defect class, each tagged `kind ∈ {deterministic, hybrid}`; sited at the stable boundary only (`just mech-check` = pre-commit / pre-review / pre-PR; `postedit-lint.sh` stays advisory); promotion (advisory → blocking) after zero `rejected` findings across a fixed replay of the last 20 merged arcs' diffs; demotion with rolling two-strikes hysteresis emitting a `gate_demotion` row + `NOTIFY`.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-31 §1 (table, kinds), §2 (hybrid classes never "low-risk"), §3 (siting rule P9(c)), §4 (promotion/demotion semantics; state outside the spec), §5 (measure before "removed"), Invariants; C-HE-35 K8(c); C-HE-24.

**Files.** Create `tools/mechanized_checks/__init__.py`, `tools/mechanized_checks/{stale_carry,mutation_probe_reverify,unswept_consumers,unrun_cli,cited_symbol_exists,delta_chain_drift,test_double_fidelity}.py`, `tools/mechanized_checks/runner.py`, `tools/test_mechanized_checks.py`, `.harness/mechanized-checks-state.json`, `tools/mutation-probe-map.json` (the machine-readable twin of the prose `# mutation-probe:` annotations: `{"<test nodeid>": {"file": ..., "lines": "A-B"}}`). Modify `justfile` (`mech-check`, `mech-replay`), `tools/hooks/postedit-lint.sh` (comment: advisory-only by contract; no exit-code change), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

**Interfaces.**
```python
# tools/mechanized_checks/__init__.py
@dataclass(frozen=True) class MechFinding(location: str, evidence: str, expected: str, severity: str = "warn")
class Check(Protocol):
    check_id: str; kind: str                       # deterministic | hybrid

- `stale_carry.py` (`kind="deterministic"`): regexes `PLACEHOLDER = r"\b(TBD|TODO\(spec\)|XXX|<NNN>|<N>|vX\.Y)\b"` → finding per hit; and count-vs-table: for each `(\b(?:one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten|\d+)\b) (contracts|rows|units|files|tests|stores)\s*:?\s*\n((?:\|.*\n)+)` in the changed markdown, compare the word/number to the table's data-row count (excluding header/separator) → finding on mismatch.
- `mutation_probe_reverify.py` (`kind="hybrid"`): reads `tools/mutation-probe-map.json`; for every `# mutation-probe:` annotation in a changed test file (`re.finditer(r"# mutation-probe: (.*)\n(?:@[^\n]*\n)*def (test_\w+)", text)`), require a map entry for `<file>::<test>` (missing → finding "annotation not mechanized"), then `probe(file, lines, test)` = `subprocess.run(["uv","run","python","tools/mutation_probe.py","--file",...,"--lines",...,"--test", f"uv run pytest {nodeid} -q"]).returncode`; `1` → finding *"annotation is FALSE: test stayed green with the named lines removed"*; `2/3` → finding "probe indeterminate". Never re-reads the annotation as evidence.
- `unswept_consumers.py` (`kind="deterministic"`): from the diff (`git diff --unified=0 origin/main...HEAD` unless injected), collect removed/renamed `def|class` names (`^-\s*(?:def|class)\s+(\w+)`), then for each name `rg -n --glob '!*.md' '\b<name>\b'` (or `graft callers <name>` when available) outside the diff's own hunks → finding per surviving consumer.
- `unrun_cli.py` (`kind="deterministic"`): `claims` = every `` `just <recipe>` `` / `` `uv run python tools/<x>.py …` `` in the PR body / commit message under a line matching `^(Verified|Checked|Ran):`; for each, `runner(cmd)` → `(rc, out)`; `rc != 0 or not out.strip()` → finding *"claimed clean but exit <rc> / empty output"*.
- `cited_symbol_exists.py` (`kind="deterministic"`): in changed `.md`, `` `<path>:<line>` `` → path must exist and have ≥ line lines; `` `<name>()` `` adjacent (same line) to a `` `<path>` `` → `re.search(rf"\b(def|class)\s+{name}\b", path_text)`; each miss → finding.
- `delta_chain_drift.py` (`kind="deterministic"`): for `` `<Stem>_v<major>_<minor>.md` §<sec> `` cites, glob later versions `<Stem>_v<major>_<minor+k>.md`; if a later version contains a heading for the same `§<sec>` → finding *"§ re-tabled in <later>; cite the last substantive definition"* (this is the workspace's delta-baseline convention, CLAUDE.md §2).
- `test_double_fidelity.py` (`kind="hybrid"`): exposes `assert_fake_is_subclass(fake, real)` for shared fixtures; the check scans changed test files for `class (Fake|Stub|Dummy)\w+\b(?!\()` (a bare class with no base) that is passed where a real type is expected (`= <FakeName>(`), reports each as *"test double without fidelity assertion"* unless a `assert_fake_is_subclass(<FakeName>` call exists in the file. (Its mutation-probe: remove the base class from a Good double → the assertion fires.)

`runner.py`: `main(["--changed", ...] | default = git diff names vs origin/main)`; runs every check; emits rows; prints per-check counts; exit 1 iff any finding from a check whose `mode == "blocking"`. Recipes: `mech-check` (runner), `mech-replay check_id` (replays the last 20 merged arcs' diffs from `git log --merges -20`, prints the rejected count = adjudication rows with `disposition=rejected` for that producer over those heads, and calls `evaluate_promotion` when 0). Initial state file: all seven `advisory`.
- [ ] **Step 4: GREEN**; the two hybrid classes' rows in the manifest are `layer2` (minutes; not phase0). Register `Row("C-HE-31", "pytest:tools/test_mechanized_checks.py", "layer2", "local + CI", True)` and `Row("C-HE-31 §4", "pytest:tools/test_mechanized_checks.py::test_promotion_demotion_state_machine", "layer2", "local + CI", False)`. `postedit-lint.sh` header comment: *"Advisory by contract (C-HE-31 §3): findings only, never a blocking exit per edit."*

### U-HE-41: Equivalence-proof rows + removal of proven double-runs

**Scope.** A duplicated execution is removed only with a `record_kind=equivalence_proof` row naming the decorrelated party (Codex / fresh reviewer) or the deterministic execution-context diff; first candidates: the two within-CI double-runs and `codex-check` re-run after CI-green on the same SHA.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-32 §1–§3 + Verification (log witness); C-HE-24.

**Files.** Modify `tools/finding_record.py` (helper `equivalence_proof_row`), `tools/test_finding_record.py` (`test_equivalence_proof_rows`), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (remove the proven double-runs), `justfile` (`codex-check` post-CI-green re-run guarded), `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md`.

**Depends on.** U-HE-01, U-HE-40 (measurement instrument present).

- [ ] **Step 1: Test**
```python
def test_equivalence_proof_rows(tmp_path):
    row = fr.equivalence_proof_row(removed="ci: pytest tools twice on same SHA", proof_by="codex-review", context_diff="identical cmd/env/inputs/sha",
                                   arc_id="pr-1", lane_id="h", head_sha="a"*40)
    fr.append_row(row, tmp_path / "g.jsonl")
    r = fr.read_rows(tmp_path / "g.jsonl")[0]
    assert r["record_kind"] == "equivalence_proof" and r["finding_type"] == "equivalence_proof" and r["disposition_actor"] == "codex-review" and r["producer"] != r["disposition_actor"]
    with pytest.raises(fr.RecordError):
        fr.equivalence_proof_row(removed="x", proof_by="ship-pr", context_diff="", arc_id="a", lane_id="l", head_sha=None, producer="ship-pr")   # beneficiary's own say-so
```
- [ ] **Step 2–3:** RED; implement `equivalence_proof_row(*, removed, proof_by, context_diff, arc_id, lane_id, head_sha, producer="ship-pr")` (raises `RecordError` when `proof_by == producer`; `disposition="accepted"`, `disposition_actor=proof_by`).

In `tools/finding_record.py`:
```python
def equivalence_proof_row(*, removed: str, proof_by: str, context_diff: str, arc_id: str, lane_id: str,
                          head_sha: str | None, producer: str = "ship-pr") -> dict:
    """C-HE-32: a duplicated execution may be removed only on a proof by a party DECORRELATED from the
    beneficiary (or a deterministic execution-context diff). The beneficiary's own say-so is refused."""
    if proof_by == producer:
        raise RecordError(f"equivalence proof by the beneficiary itself ({producer}) is prohibited (C-HE-32 §3)")
    core = FindingCore(make_finding_id(producer, head_sha or "nohead", removed, 0), removed,
                       f"removed duplicated execution; proof: {context_diff}", "C-HE-32 §1", "info",
                       "equivalence_proof", "decorrelated", producer)
    return make_row(core, Envelope("equivalence_proof", now_iso(), arc_id, lane_id, head_sha, None, None, None,
                                   cause_attribution="duplicate_execution_removed", disposition="accepted",
                                   disposition_actor=proof_by))
```
Recipe: `equivalence-proof removed proof_by context_diff:` → `uv run python -c "import finding_record as fr, os; fr.append_row(fr.equivalence_proof_row(removed='{{removed}}', proof_by='{{proof_by}}', context_diff='{{context_diff}}', arc_id=os.environ.get('HARNESS_ARC_ID','policy'), lane_id=os.environ.get('HARNESS_LANE_ID','ship-pr-lane'), head_sha=None))"`.
 Then: (1) identify the two within-CI double-runs by reading `ci.yml` job steps for identical `run:` lines on the same checkout (the executor lists them in the PR body); (2) obtain the proof — `just codex-review` on the removal diff with the prompt "confirm the two removed steps are byte-identical executions (command, env, inputs, SHA)"; record the row via a `just equivalence-proof` recipe wrapping the helper; (3) remove the steps; (4) `codex-check` after CI-green on the same SHA: `ship-pr` step reworded to *"skip `just codex-check` when the CI `codex-context-guard` job on this exact SHA is green (equivalence proof row `<finding_id>` recorded 2026-08-…)"*.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Register `Row("C-HE-32/33", "pytest:tools/test_finding_record.py::test_equivalence_proof_rows", "layer2", "CI", False)`. Commit `chore(he-lanes): U-HE-41 equivalence-proof rows; remove proven CI double-runs (C-HE-32)`.

---

### U-HE-42: Local/CI parity for `codex_context_guard` — `just codex-context-check-ci`

**Scope.** Close K3 as a flag/ref-parity gap: add a local recipe mirroring CI's explicit-ref invocation (`check --base-ref <merge-base> --head-ref HEAD --allow-roadmap-drift`), and a parity test asserting the same finding set for the same SHA between the CI-shaped and local-shaped invocations (or the documented, named exclusion).

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-33 §1–§4 (target ~58 s; environment-irreproducible checks named; corrected claim; outcome measure via C-HE-28 cohorts).

**Files.** Modify `justfile:84-87` (add `codex-context-check-ci`), `tools/test_codex_context_guard.py` (`test_local_ci_parity`), `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md` (pre-push: run the CI-shaped recipe).

**Depends on.** U-HE-33.

- [ ] **Step 1: Test**
```python
def test_local_ci_parity(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Same SHA: CI-shaped and local-shaped invocations → identical finding codes (named exclusions only)."""
    ci = ccg.main(["check", "--base-ref", base, "--head-ref", head, "--allow-roadmap-drift", "--json"])  # capture stdout json
    local = ccg.main(["check", "--base-ref", base, "--head-ref", head, "--allow-roadmap-drift", "--json", "--local-shape"])
    assert codes(ci) - EXCLUDED == codes(local) - EXCLUDED
    assert EXCLUDED == {"OPEN_PRS_UNAVAILABLE"}   # gh-dependent: named, not silently dropped
```

# S8 — Shadow trial, wired live

### U-HE-43: `tools/shadow_trial.py` — scoring reducer, `no_finding` markers, kill rule n=30 / < 2, OC table, HITL delivery

**Scope.** The second reviewer's shadow lens runs live off the blocking path from the first Arc-7 deploy: `ship-pr` invokes it after the blocking chain (non-blocking); every scored round emits finding rows or exactly one `no_finding` marker with `producer=<second_reviewer_identity>`; `unique_catch=true` iff (a) location+finding_type absent from blocking reviewers' rows for the same `head_sha` AND (b) last disposition `accepted`; the reducer reproduces the kill/keep decision from `merge-gate-log.jsonl` alone; the pre-committed rule (n=30, kill if < 2) and its OC table are recomputed by the test from the binomial; at round n the decision fires as an escalation-kind HITL request; adjudicator identity is `disposition_actor` of neither model family.

**Spec linkage.** C-HE-29 §1–§5, Invariants, Verification (reducer over 30 synthetic rounds; OC unit); §11 #10 (SPRT permitted alternative — recorded, not adopted); C-HE-24 §2 (`no_finding`, `unique_catch`, `disposition_actor`).

**Files.** Create `tools/shadow_trial.py`, `tools/test_shadow_trial.py`. Modify `.claude/skills/ship-pr/SKILL.md` (off-path invocation), `justfile` (`shadow-trial-score`, `shadow-trial-decide`), `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/codex-parity-check.sh`.

**Interfaces.**
```python
N_ROUNDS = 30; KILL_IF_FEWER_THAN = 2
def config_row(*, lens: str, n=N_ROUNDS, threshold=KILL_IF_FEWER_THAN) -> dict          # recorded so amendments are auditable

def unique_catches(rows, lens) -> list[dict]                                             # (a) ∧ (b)

# Close-out

### U-HE-44: Forward-register rows for spec §11 + plan evidence log

**Scope.** Register the six carry-forwards the spec sends to the forward register as `B-*` rows (`.harness/forward-register.yaml` via `tools/forward_register.py`): #3 P9(a) prewritten testable done-condition; #4 K7 stop rule (prereqs C-HE-26 §3); #9 cross-carrier merge-door fencing (joint Claude/Codex arc; incl. `AGENTS.md:56-57` #3 restatement + Docker isolation for Codex legs; **operator may reverse the v1 scoping**); #10 SPRT alternative for the shadow-trial rule; #11 cross-`head_sha` `finding_id` tracking; #12 randomized lane assignment; plus the plan-level rows: the `result_capture` divergence audit-worthiness question (§11 #5, decided "recorded, not audit-worthy in v1"), the reservation bootstrap-at-drain migration path (U-HE-19), the `severity` dual vocabulary note (U-HE-01), §11 #13 (queue-depth cap once N-lane cadence data exists), the C-HE-06 §7 invariant-wording vs G4-continuation tension (plan §6 item 13; v1.1 change-note candidate), and the six residual defect classes from the plan's codex rounds (§7 item 8) — one row each, tagged as U-HE-40 mechanized-check candidates. Create `.harness/plan/evidence-log-he-loop-lanes.md` with the sections the units above append to (branch-protection show/apply/tiebreaker; reviewer-concurrency probe verdicts; pilot reports; RED-first runs of AC#2; equivalence proofs).

**Spec linkage.** §11 #3, #4, #5, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13; C-HE-30 (evidence log is not a store — a plan artifact).

**Files.** Modify `.harness/forward-register.yaml` (via the tool); create `.harness/plan/evidence-log-he-loop-lanes.md`.

**Depends on.** (none for the rows; the log is appended by U-HE-20, 27, 35, 37, 41).

- [ ] **Step 1:** `uv run python tools/forward_register.py add …` one row each (title, source `Spec_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1 §11 #N`, disposition per the spec column, `operator_may_reverse: true` on #9). Parse-check the YAML (`uv run --with pyyaml python -c "import yaml,sys; list(yaml.safe_load_all(open(sys.argv[1])))" .harness/forward-register.yaml`). `just forward-register-check` green.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Evidence log skeleton (headings only + the RED-first table with columns *unit / test / unfixed commit / RED output line / GREEN commit*).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Commit `ops(he-lanes): U-HE-44 forward-register rows for spec §11 + plan evidence log`.

### U-HE-45: Roadmap wiring — register the S1–S8 arcs and the pilot bar

**Scope.** Add the plan's arcs to the roadmap's forward tracking so `/roadmap-continue` derives them: one `B-*` row per S-step (S1, S2, S3, S4a, S4b, S4c, S4d, S5, S6, S7, S8) with `depends_on` per §6, unit ranges from this plan, and the two gate columns; the pilot bar row (`≥ 3 pilots at 3–4 lanes`) marked as gating follow-on orchestration only.

**Spec linkage.** §6 (order + gates), C-HE-13 §3; CLAUDE.md §12 (roadmap protocol; refresh via `tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py`).

**Files.** Modify `.harness/forward-register.yaml` (rows), `.harness/roadmap_status.md` (next-action paragraph pointing at S1 = U-HE-01), via the idempotent scripts.

**Depends on.** U-HE-44.

- [ ] **Step 1–2:** add rows; run `uv run python tools/roadmap_status_refresh.py --next-action "<one paragraph: 'Execute Implementation_Plan_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1 §2 in topological order starting at U-HE-01 (finding record) — S1/S2 roots; Phase 0 = U-HE-01..33 gates N ≥ 2.'>"` as part of the doc-only PR's terminating refresh (CLAUDE.md §12.2.1).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Commit `ops: roadmap status refresh post-#<PR>` (the terminating refresh, roadmap_status.md only) — after the doc-only PR that carries the spec + ADRs + council ledger + this plan merges.

## §6 Open items (plan-shape observations; none blocks execution)

| # | Item | Where decided / carried |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `severity` on the finding record accepts both the reviewer triple `P1|P2|P3` (C-HE-15 §4) and the projection triple `hard|warn|info` (C-HE-31 §4(c) writes `warn`). If a single vocabulary is preferred, that is a v1.1 spec note. | U-HE-01; flag at plan review |
| 2 | The fail-class vocabulary (`transient-retry`, `permanent-fail-exit`, `HITL-recoverable`, `terminal-…`) is carried in `finding_type`; `code` = `<producer>:<finding_type>:<cause_attribution>`. Reading of C-HE-24 §3 + C-HE-16 §3 stated explicitly. | U-HE-01 |
| 3 | Legacy queue entries (queued before reservations exist) get a reservation **bootstrapped at drain** (`arc_type_declared_at="close"`, `NOTIFY` emitted) — a one-time migration path, not a standing mechanism; remove after the queue drains once post-S4b. | U-HE-19; forward-register row (U-HE-44) |
| 4 | `arc_metrics` ↔ `reservations` import cycle is broken by importing `reservations` inside the functions that need it. | U-HE-19 |
| 5 | `loop_hil_groups` uses `mktime/strftime/asorti` (gawk); macOS ships BSD awk — the executor MUST vendor epoch math in bash (both platforms run the hook tests). | U-HE-30 |
| 6 | HITL rows for reservation escalations key on `arc_id` (`pr-N`, `B-…`), so `pr-N` items render in the summary and coalescing but do not enter `loop_skip_set()` (which filters `R-/B-`). Acceptable for v1; if skip-set membership is wanted, key escalations on the roadmap unit id. | U-HE-18; observation |
| 7 | §11 #5 decided in S5: a `result_capture` process-exit vs log-write divergence is **recorded (both timestamps on the row), not audit-worthy in v1** — no finding on divergence. | U-HE-34; forward-register row |
| 8 | Council-dependent contracts (C-HE-07; C-HE-06 §7 + §4-timeout; C-HE-09 §1) are built as normative. If a v1.1 change-note strikes one, the affected units are U-HE-25 (whole), U-HE-22 `HolderInvariant` + U-HE-23 `MERGE_TIMEOUT_S`, U-HE-29 §1 (single file) — struck by change-note; nothing else depends on them except as §6 notes. | spec §13 |
| 9 | Branch protection is a **two-step**: `apply` after U-HE-27, then re-`verify`/re-`apply` after U-HE-33 adds the `split-brain … — blocking` job (the context list is re-derived from `ci.yml`). | U-HE-27, U-HE-33; evidence log |
| 10 | The single operator gate in this plan is `just main-protection-apply` (outward-facing GitHub settings change) — one AskUserQuestion with the diff shown. Everything else is Claude-driven to its genuine gate (CLAUDE.md §12.4.1). The reviewer-concurrency probe and pilots are live but subscription-auth ($0 metered) and pre-authorized. | U-HE-27 |
| 11 | §11 #13 (queue-depth cap once N-lane cadence data exists) and #10 (SPRT alternative) are registered, not built. | U-HE-44 |
| 12 | The reservation `pending`-aged and `open`-stuck HITL rows use `HITL-recoverable` in the cause triple; the spec names the escalation but not a fail-class — this follows C-HE-06 §9's convention for human-actionable waits. | U-HE-18 |
| 13 | **Spec-internal tension (surfaced by Codex round 2, not absorbed):** C-HE-06 §7's Invariants bullet "no lease exists whose reservation is not `open`" cannot hold literally across the G4 continuation — C-HE-03 §4 flips the reservation to `merged` on confirmed merge while C-HE-06 §4(vii)–(viii) holds the lease through post-merge CI + the refresh. The plan implements §7 as its *text* says (acquisition-time verification; `acquire()` refuses a non-open reservation) and treats the continuation window as the G4-authorized state. Owed: a v1.1 change-note re-wording the invariant to "no lease is *acquired* against a non-open reservation; a held lease outlives its reservation's `merged` transition only inside the §4(vii)–(ix) continuation". Registered as a forward-register row by U-HE-44. | U-HE-22/23; spec §14 |

## §7 Self-review (writing-plans checklist, run after assembly)

1. **Spec coverage.** Every `C-HE-01`…`C-HE-35` row in §4 has ≥ 1 unit with section-level cites; §5 (files table) is honored file-for-file — the only additions beyond spec §5 are helper modules the listed files import (`tools/lane_ports.py`, `tools/lanes_pilot.py`, `tools/main_protection.py`, `tools/merge_gate_log.py`, `tools/lanes_verify.py`, `tools/review_wrapper_common.py` is in §5), each named in its unit; §6 order is followed with the two stated refinements; §8.1 rows all appear in §5 above; §11 items are carried by U-HE-44. Gaps found and closed during self-review: (a) C-HE-04 §6 (teardown guard) had no unit of its own — it lands with U-HE-15 Step 4b (`hook_worktree_local_state` gains the `rev-list @{u}..HEAD` refusal + its mutation-probe) and the coverage row says so; (b) C-HE-06 §10 attestation tiering — folded into U-HE-23 (`_tiering_active` reads, `land()` writes one file per clean cycle under `DOOR/tier-clean-cycles`; listed in the U-HE-14 store audit's derived families).
2. **Placeholder scan.** No `TBD`, `TODO`, "implement later", "fill in", "add appropriate error handling", "similar to Task N" in any step. Where a step says "the executor reads the exact line numbers from the file they just wrote", it is because `--lines` for a mutation probe cannot be known until the code exists — the guard being reverted is named in every case.
3. **Type consistency (names used across units).** `fr.FindingCore / fr.Envelope / fr.make_row / fr.append_row / fr.read_rows / fr.reduce_last_by_finding_id / fr.make_finding_id / fr.now_iso` (U-01) are used unchanged by U-02, 04, 06, 07, 13, 23, 33, 34, 40, 41, 43. `rw.Attempt / rw.ReviewOutcome / rw.parse_verdict / rw.run_with_retry / rw.run_with_failover / rw.classify / rw.compute_binding / rw.exit_code / rw.outcome_rows / rw.env_arc_and_lane` (U-02) are used unchanged by U-04, 06, 07, 35. `rs.reserve / rs.transition / rs.update_payload / rs.transfer_holder / rs.record_phase / rs.holder / rs.selectable / rs.current / rs.open_with_sensor / rs.reconcile / rs.emit_loop_row / rs.mint_lane_id` (U-17/18) are used unchanged by U-19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 36, 40, 43. `am.ci_is_green / am.CI_TERMINAL` (U-08) → U-23. `am.LANE_ID / am._kill_after / am._hold_after / am._restore_or_republish / am._drain_one / am._reconcile_local_rows` (U-15/19/20). `lv.Row / lv.Result / lv.MANIFEST / lv.run_row / lv.phase0_rows / lv.phase0_verdict / lv.coverage_gaps` (U-05) → U-37. `md.acquire / md.release / md.reclaim / md.unblock / md.win_marker / md.mark_attempted / md.mark_blocked / md.read_lease / md.land / md.wait_for_door / md.Ground` (U-22/23) → U-25, 28, 33. `loop_log_structured / loop_status_path / loop_hil_groups / loop_hil_deliver / loop_notify_summary / _LOOP_AWK_ROW` (U-29/30) → U-09 (upgraded shape), U-18, U-31, U-32. One fix applied during review: U-HE-09 (S1) emits `NOTIFY` before U-HE-29 defines the structured kind — its row is written via legacy `loop_log` and the U-HE-29 reducer treats it as a legacy row (stated in U-HE-09).

4. **Codex round 1 on PR #1393 (out-of-family, cold) — 7 P1 / 4 P2, all absorbed in this PR.** P1: (a) marker/plan exit-gate mismatch → status block + marker now name this review as the plan's exit gate; (b) `round_outcomes` never written → `reservations.record_round_outcome` + `rw.record_round_outcome_if_reserved` called by both wrappers + folded at drain (U-HE-17/02/04/06/19); (c) `transition(updates)`/`update_payload` could rewrite `lane_id`/`arc_type`/`superseded_by` → `PAYLOAD_MUTABLE`/`TRANSITION_MUTABLE` allowlists + test (U-HE-17; U-HE-18's aging test now uses `now=`); (d) `BASE_TOCTOU` mismatch emitted but did not block → door blocks + HITL + test (U-HE-23); (e) resume re-created the refresh PR → resume from the recorded sidecar + test (U-HE-23); (f) coalescing delivery race / later-generation suppression → exclusive-create claim per exact generation under `QUEUE_DIR/hil-deliveries/` + concurrency test (U-HE-30; store audit lists the family); (g) shadow scored rounds collapsed across arcs → `(arc_id, round_n)` + test (U-HE-43). P2: artifact polling capped by the shared 1260 s deadline + test (U-HE-04); adjudication append enforces the same-core invariant against the ORIGINAL row + test (U-HE-01); reservation GC retention runs from the terminal head's `transitioned_at` + test (U-HE-17); HIL groups sorted by epoch, gawk-free pipeline (U-HE-30). Round 2 result is recorded in the PR.

5. **Codex round 2 on PR #1393 — 8 P1 / 3 P2, all new surfaces (no round-1 item re-flagged), all absorbed.** P1: session-artifact JSONL is decoded before verdict parsing (`artifact_text`, U-HE-04); `review-with-failover` no longer pre-gates on `_require-codex-subscription` (a permanent Codex failure must reach the failover, U-HE-07); same-lane reclaim still requires the old pid dead (U-HE-22); a crashed reclaimer's marker carries the fresh lease and `complete_dead_marker` publishes it (U-HE-22); the C-HE-06 §7 invariant-vs-G4 continuation tension is surfaced as open item 13 (acquisition-time enforcement; v1.1 change-note candidate; U-HE-22/23); the `DoorFailed` handler decides release-vs-block from `read_lease()` and blocks after an attempt (U-HE-23); push-to-main is parsed (options anywhere, every refspec, bare push) instead of the reference regex (U-HE-26); the tiebreaker verdict comes from the stale PR alone (U-HE-27). P2: failover path emits no duplicate gemini rows (U-HE-07); TTL resurface reducer is shape-aware for HIL rows (U-HE-09); the shadow-trial sample is frozen at the first n scored rounds (U-HE-43). Round 3 result recorded in the PR.
6. **Codex round 3 on PR #1393 — 11 P1 / 4 P2, all absorbed (three were consequences of round-2 edits — the tiebreaker's tautological first-parent compare, the reclaim publish window, and the status block's "round 2 clean" wording, which was false the moment round 2 returned findings and is now replaced by this record).** P1: holder-only terminal transitions (U-HE-17); reclaim verifies the published lease is its own token, never adopts a foreign lease (U-HE-22); tiebreaker runs in a throwaway worktree, compares the stale landing with the pre-merge main SHA, and `apply` is provisional with automatic rollback on FAIL (U-HE-27); `unique_catch` gets a production writer — `shadow_trial.py adjudicate` (U-HE-43); probe coverage matches every annotation's exact node id (U-HE-05); `unrun_cli` never shells out (U-HE-40); pilot report joins `BASE_TOCTOU` by the landing `merge_sha` now persisted on the reservation, and scopes HIL rows to the pilot's lanes + window with last-write-wins (U-HE-37/23); status block no longer asserts a clean round in advance (§ status). P2: envelope fields immutable on adjudication (U-HE-01); `BASE_TOCTOU` backstop walks first-parent commits (U-HE-33); failover emits when the gemini recipe died at preflight (U-HE-07); `loop_log_structured` returns 1 on write failure and `emit_loop_row` raises `LoopStatusWriteError` (U-HE-29/17).
7. **Codex round 4 on PR #1393 — 7 P1 / 1 P2, all absorbed.** P1: the AC#2(c) crash-resume test body is real code (a `gh`/`git` shim on PATH, four parametrized kill points, rc 137 → resume rc 0, `merge-calls.log` == 1) instead of a `...` stand-in (U-HE-23); `emit_refresh_pr` is idempotent by branch name so a crash between PR creation and the sidecar publish resumes the existing PR (U-HE-28); refresh-CI failure emits the gate finding + `DEFERRED-HIL` before blocking (U-HE-23); `_push_targets_main` strips quotes so `'HEAD:main'` is fenced (U-HE-26); `main-protection-apply` is a dry run (exit 3) and `apply-confirm` is the mutation, so the operator approves the printed payload (U-HE-27); rollback restores a normalized PUT payload and verifies it, else fails loud "main UNPROTECTED" (U-HE-27); this record itself (the exit gate's terminal item was owed before merge). P2: the lease rate counter ignores `.tmp` remnants and sweeps them (U-HE-22). **Terminal round: item 8.**
8. **Codex round 5 on PR #1393 (terminal) — 7 P1 / 10 P2, all absorbed; stopping rule applied.** P1: rollback preserves user/team/app `restrictions` and the PUT payload carries the required nullable `restrictions` key (U-HE-27); `shadow_trial.adjudicate` persists on the production path (U-HE-43); commit-before-probe is now a plan-wide convention (the probe tool refuses untracked/dirty targets) and U-HE-01's steps are reordered accordingly; `append_row`/`read_rows` resolve the ledger path at call time so tests never write the real ledger (U-HE-01, every emitter); `lanes_verify` tokenizes `just` args and treats placeholder rows as live, and probe coverage recognises `bash <script>` probes (U-HE-05). P2: door GC skips `.tmp` attempt remnants (U-HE-22); the stack recipe calls `lane_stack_allowed` (U-HE-31); the two-lane compose test is a real body (U-HE-31); `unswept_consumers` diffs the working tree and no longer excludes whole changed files (U-HE-40); `unrun_cli` reads the PR body and warns when it cannot (U-HE-40); the deliverer clamps the window like the grouper, legacy rows are singleton groups, `loop_notify_summary` enforces its 24 h horizon (U-HE-29/30); lane-init fails on index exhaustion (U-HE-31). **Verdict + stopping rule.** P1 yield across rounds was 7 / 8 / 11 / 7 / 7 — flat, not converging: a cold out-of-family reviewer finds real defects in ~7 k lines of *invented, not-yet-executed* code at a steady rate, and each round's fixes open a few new surfaces (rounds 3–5 each contained 2–3 findings against round-(n−1) edits). Continuing to review the plan text is therefore not the cheapest path to correctness; **executing** it is — every unit lands RED-first with its own tests, then `just codex-review` on the PR diff, then the 3-lens `merge-gate` (code PRs). **Residual classes** (what the five rounds kept finding, and what unit-execution review must watch for): (a) crash-window idempotency in multi-step filesystem protocols (marker → move → publish; sidecar → PR create); (b) test bodies that are stand-ins (`...`) or that pass vacuously; (c) payload-shape mismatches against a live API (GET vs PUT shapes; required nullable fields); (d) string-parsing edge cases in the permission guard (quotes, options anywhere); (e) default-argument capture vs call-time resolution; (f) invariant statements that hold at one time (acquisition) but not across a window (continuation). These six are registered by U-HE-44 as forward-register rows *and* as candidate classes for U-HE-40's mechanized checks (each is deterministic or hybrid-checkable). No finding from rounds 1–5 remains unaddressed in the plan text.
## Execution handoff

Plan complete and saved to `.harness/plan/Implementation_Plan_HE_Loop_Lanes_v1.md`. Two execution options:

1. **Subagent-driven (recommended for S1–S4)** — one fresh subagent per unit in topological order, each given only its unit text + the Global Constraints + Conventions sections; review between units; the S-step boundary is the PR boundary (`ship-pr`); the merge-gate 3-lens review runs on every code PR.
2. **Inline execution** — `/roadmap-continue` derives U-HE-01 as the next action once U-HE-45's rows land; execute unit-by-unit in this session with checkpoints at each S-step.

Either way the entry gate is the spec's clearance marker (spec §14) — the same doc-only PR that carries the spec, the ADRs, the council ledger, and this plan.
