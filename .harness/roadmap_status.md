## Next action

**Purpose.** Live pointer to the next Claude/Codex-executable frontier. Full round-by-round history (every prior round, verbatim, most-recent-first) lives in the archive below — grep it by PR/`B-`/`R-`-id/round, never read wholesale.

**Current next action (post-#1407).** S4b continues: U-HE-18 is on main (#1407). The recommended next action / next implementable unit is `U-HE-19` (drain-reservation integration: flip-before-append, holder-gated append, dead-claim holder transfer, local-row reconciliation, phases fold — C-HE-04 §2/§4/§5, C-HE-03 §4/§6, C-HE-27 §3 — plan §S4b), then U-HE-20/21 per plan §3. Registered residuals close there and beyond: R17-a/R17-b + transfer_holder deadness + update_payload merge-tuple (U-HE-19); wrapper arc-id minting (U-HE-21); detached-launch supervision, RESOLVED-HIL minting, aged/closed-pointer emission dedup, the §0-note-vs-§1-index S4b/S4d ordering contradiction, and the activation-gate go-live witness (U-HE-29). Alternatives if the operator defers the lanes program: B-186 step (1), B-160, B-148 (unchanged).

**Archive.** `.harness/roadmap-next-action-archive.md` (PRIOR rounds only, verbatim as each stood when superseded — the current round lives only in this head; the newest superseded round may lag there until the next content PR archives it, and is always losslessly recoverable from this file's own git history meanwhile).

## Remaining forward work

**The full-spec build (R-FS-1).** The single full-spec umbrella **R-FS-1** has no `B-*` forward build arcs remaining and is RESOLVED after manual Tier-1 gates G1.4/G1.7/G1.8 were signed. `R-CL-Q1`, `R-CL-Q2`, `R-CL-Q3`, `R-CL-Q4`, `R-CL-D1`, and `R-CL-C1` are RESOLVED; stale governance entries `R-IF-114` and `R-IF-115` are RESOLVED; `R-600-pattern-bake-in-sweep` cadence-8 is ACTIVE-SURVEYED (promoted `mutation-probe-as-load-bearing-witness` as PD-8 at workflow v1.18 — the cadence-7 card-frontier flag, now closed); `R-600-codex-out-of-family-review` is RESOLVED. The new operator-selected implementation frontier is the full memory substrate build below.

**Full memory substrate build.** The approved design packet from PR #853 is now implemented through the planned provider-free closeout sequence. U-MEM-01 is merged at PR #855, U-MEM-02 is merged at PR #857, U-MEM-03 is merged at PR #859, U-MEM-04 is merged at PR #861, U-MEM-05 is merged at PR #863, U-MEM-06 is merged at PR #865, U-MEM-07 is merged at PR #867, U-MEM-08 is merged at PR #869, U-MEM-09 is merged at PR #871, U-MEM-10 is merged at PR #877, U-MEM-11 is merged at PR #879, U-MEM-12 is merged at PR #881, U-MEM-13 is merged at PR #883, U-MEM-14 is merged at PR #885, U-MEM-15 is merged at PR #887, U-MEM-16 is merged at PR #889, U-MEM-17 is merged at PR #891, U-MEM-18 is merged at PR #893, U-MEM-19 is merged at PR #895, U-MEM-20 is merged at PR #897, U-MEM-21 is merged at PR #899, U-MEM-22 is merged at PR #901, U-MEM-23 is merged at PR #903, U-MEM-24 is merged at PR #905, and U-MEM-25 is merged at PR #907. No U-MEM forward implementation unit remains. Live Anthropic native-memory plus Claude Code and Codex CLI auth confirmations are recorded by U-MEM-live-confirmations; Antigravity is CONFIRMED live via `agy` (PR #1136) and generic-command PASSED live with the standing `ollama list` probe (PR #1137); legacy Gemini is terminally NOT CONFIRMED on this host — its declared `gemini -p` probe fired live and was refused upstream (`IneligibleTierError`, client deprecated for individual accounts, superseded by the Antigravity route).

**Single arc→unit source.** The full itemization — every arc + unit in plain language, with status, build position, dependencies, and as-built units — lives in the single structured source **`.harness/arc-ledger.yaml`** (derived by `tools/arc_ledger.py`, rendered in the dashboard's Arc & unit map; the forward `B-*` register is shown with decompose-at-open markers). The spine ledger `.harness/beyond-mvp-capability-boundary-ledger.md` carries every surfaced boundary's rationale; per-arc grounding leads at `.harness/r-fs-1-remaining-arcs-grounding-sweep-v1.md` (re-ground at arc-open, presence-not-correctness).

**Frozen order** (B1→B3→E→B2→R→B4→CA→B5→B6→B7→M) — **COMPLETE, 11/11.** R-FS-1 standalone `B-*` register is **69 closed / 0 forward / 0 gated / 4 resolved** in `.harness/arc-ledger.yaml`; `snapshot.rfs1_status: resolved` and `closure_gate.py` G1.1 = **0+0**. Manual Tier-1 closure gates G1.4/G1.7/G1.8 are recorded at `.harness/r-fs-1-tier1-manual-signoff.json`; **R-CL-Q1**, **R-CL-Q2**, **R-CL-Q3**, **R-CL-Q4**, **R-CL-D1**, and **R-CL-C1** are resolved.

**Audit status:** 2026-06-07 cadence pass closed in this PR: sandbox execution-driver fork refreshed from historical PROPOSING; Path (i) durable-async fork leading status token normalized to `**Status:**`; stale roadmap sample row for the already-applied `harness.toml` fork refreshed; no other stale fork-doc headline status lines found. Next cadence: ~5 PRs or operator-discretion.

## Phase 7 retirement progress

> **🎓 PHASE-8 GRADUATION + BATCH-56 LIVE LEDGER.** The R-700 reconciliation is CLOSED — the operator ratified **accounting (i)** (PR #246) and lifted the declaration hold. Historical declaration: **RETIRED 46/54 (85.2%) + pipeline-advanced 49/54 (90.7%)**. Batch-52 back-flowed the live R-810/R-820 evidence for AS-8e, AS-8f, and CP-17; batch-53 back-flows the OD-4 runtime residual and the 0-wireable CXA-4 bookkeeping row; batch-54 lands the CP→AS runtime composer; batch-55 records CXA-2 as a counted bounded residual; batch-56 records CXA-1 as substantively retired after the AS→IS producer and edge-scope audit: **live ledger RETIRED 54/54 (100.0%) + pipeline-advanced 54/54 (100.0%)**. Prior batch records stand verbatim; this section reports the current live 54-row set derived from `.harness/substitutions.yaml`.

The bucket rows below sum to **54** under the batch-56 live ledger (RETIRED 54).

| Bucket | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RETIRED | **54/54 (100.0%)** live (batch-56) | 43 substantive + 8 authoring-only + 3 bounded-residual (CP-16, OD-6, CXA-2). IS 9/9; AS 11/11; CP 21/21; OD 8/8; CXA 5/5. Phase-8 historical declaration remains 46/54; batch-52 added AS-8e, AS-8f, and CP-17 after R-810/R-820 live proofs; batch-53 adds OD-4 and CXA-4 after accounting/back-flow; batch-54 adds CXA-3 after the CP→AS runtime composer landed; batch-55 adds CXA-2 as bounded residual after producer-loop evidence landed; batch-56 adds CXA-1 after the AS→IS producer and edge-scope audit landed. |
| RETIRE-READY | **0 active (bucket EMPTY post-batch-51)** | OD-3 + OD-6 transited RETIRE-READY → RETIRED at batch-51 (PR #200). |
| PARTIAL | **0** | Empty after batch-56. CXA-1 moved to SUBSTANTIVE_RETIRED after the AS→IS edge-scope audit and resolver-bound secret-fetch write landed. |
| STILL-BOUNDED | **0** | Empty after batch-55 and remains empty after batch-56. |
| RETIRED-AS-AUTHORING-ONLY | **8** (of the 54 RETIRED) | accounting (i): IS-4, IS-10, AS-9, CP-12, CP-23, OD-1, OD-7, OD-8 (accounting (ii) = 9, adds CP-24). The H_T contract is the typed declaration itself; no runtime behavior (sub-species 10 categorical-mismatch). |
| RETIRED-AS-BOUNDED-RESIDUAL | **3** (of the 54 RETIRED — *counted*) | CP-16 (memory, batch-44) + OD-6 (OTLP, batch-51 — FIRST in ledger) + CXA-2 (CP→IS durable recovery, batch-55). Production substrate dormant or post-MVP at MVP; substantive close deferred to a real deployment/recovery surface (X-AL-2 §5.3). |

**Decomposition status (R-002 RESOLVED 2026-05-31) + R-700 draft correction (2026-06-01):** R-002 mapped all non-RETIRED rows *in the per-axis `§4.1` view* to R-NNN entries — IS-2 (R-003 + R-001-h-t-is-2-retired), OD-3 (R-007), OD-4 (R-008), OD-6 (R-009), AS-8e (R-005), AS-8f (R-006); R-001 (OD-5) + R-004 (AS-8d) reconciled stale BLOCKED → RESOLVED. **The R-700 draft surfaced that the R-002 survey covered only `§4.1`, which excludes the CXA axis (no `§4.1` file) + CP-17's SB-INDEF reclassification — so 5 non-RETIRED rows (`CXA-1`/`CXA-2`/`CXA-3`/`CXA-4` + `CP-17`) have NO `R-NNN` entries.** Recommended follow-on (draft §C item 2): an `R-002`-style Surface-I decomposition pass over CXA + CP-17. **→ CLOSED at PR #246 (R-700 PART C item 2):** grounding found CXA-1/2/3/4 already had `R-CXA-1..4` (authored #209); NEW `R-010-cp-17-files-indefinite` authored for CP-17 → all 5 flagged rows now have dedicated entries. Ratified at the Phase-8 graduation (2026-06-02).

- [ ] `recently_completed` reflects last 5 merged PRs
- [ ] `latest_retirement_batch` matches `ls .harness/phase-7d-retirement-events-batch-*.md | tail -1`
- [ ] No `R-NNN` at `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §5 has `status: ACTIVE` while its `depends_on` are not all RESOLVED (re-derive per §4)

If any check fails → HALT, route per `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §7.1 step 4.
