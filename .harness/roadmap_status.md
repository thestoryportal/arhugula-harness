# Roadmap status dashboard

*Refreshed at session-start audit + post-PR-merge audit per workspace `CLAUDE.md` §12. Consumed by the next-action derivation rule at `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §4. **Do not hand-edit during execution — refresh via the protocol at `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §7.2.***

## Next action

**`R-001-h-t-is-2-retired`** (status: **ACTIVE** — unblocked at the R-003 close; phase-7; cross_axis: no) — file the **H_T-IS-2 PARTIAL → RETIRED** retirement event. R-003's producer-site cascade is now complete (PR #136 Cluster A + #137 Cluster B): all **7** IS-2 producer sites handled — **4 lifted** (`sub_agent_dispatch`, `hitl_gate_composer`, `sibling_ledger`, `workflow_driver` per-step) + **3 documented None-canonical** (`audit_writer`, `as_is_wiring`, `shadow_git_rollback`). Execution = author `.harness/phase-7d-retirement-events-batch-NN.md` (next batch after 49) recording the PARTIAL → RETIRED transit + verify X-AL-2 second conjunct, then refresh `harness-is/CLAUDE.md` §4.1 + `.harness/phase-7d-retirement-ledger-v2.md` §3. close_shape = retirement-event; cascade → R-IF-roadmap-refresh; next_pointer → R-002 (already RESOLVED, so re-derive). `advisor_required: no`.

**(R-003 RESOLVED at PR #136 + #137 merge `5e4a112` + `c339728` 2026-05-31 — producer-site lifts delivered across two clusters; 2281 tests pass; ruff+pyright clean. `resume:`/checkpoint pointer removed per §3.)**

## Phase 7 retirement progress

| Bucket | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RETIRED | 35+ (per batch-49; incl. AS-8d batch-31 + OD-5 batch-32 via mech-β) | See `harness-*/CLAUDE.md` §4.1 + `phase-7d-retirement-events-batch-*.md` for canonical enumeration. CP-axis §4.1 fully RETIRED. |
| RETIRE-READY | 2 active (**OD-3 + OD-6**) | OD-3 (R-007) + OD-6 (R-009) await real-deployment X-AL-2 second conjunct OR operator-AUQ Reading α. **Corrected at R-002 survey 2026-05-31: AS-8d + OD-5 are RETIRED (batches 31-32), not RETIRE-READY — prior table was stale.** |
| PARTIAL | H_T-IS-2 (R-001-h-t-is-2-retired, ACTIVE) + H_T-OD-4 (R-008) | IS-2 producer-site cascade COMPLETE — R-003 RESOLVED at PR #136 + #137 (4 sites lifted + 3 documented None-canonical); IS-2 stays PARTIAL only until R-001-h-t-is-2-retired files the PARTIAL → RETIRED retirement event (now ACTIVE). OD-4 awaits §13.1 per-session toggle + §13.2 tokenization gate closures (R-008). |
| STILL-BOUNDED-INDEFINITELY | 2 (AS-8e + AS-8f) | AS-8e files.* (R-005 DEFERRED) + AS-8f managed_agents.* (R-006 DEFERRED) — indefinite-defer per runtime spec v1.17 §14.C / v1.33; X-AL-2 bounded-residual carry. |
| RETIRED-AS-AUTHORING-ONLY | 4 | Sub-species 10 closures (OD-1, OD-7, IS-4, CP-23) per batches 37+38+39+41 |

**Decomposition COMPLETE (R-002 RESOLVED 2026-05-31):** all non-RETIRED rows mapped to R-NNN entries at roadmap §5.2 — IS-2 (R-003 + R-001-h-t-is-2-retired), OD-3 (R-007), OD-4 (R-008), OD-6 (R-009), AS-8e (R-005), AS-8f (R-006). R-001 (OD-5) + R-004 (AS-8d) reconciled stale BLOCKED → RESOLVED. Execution of each per-row entry gated as noted (most on real-deployment / operator-decision; R-003 producer-lifts is the lone executable-now phase-7 entry).

| 2026-05-31 | Dashboard creation (v1 origin) | n/a |
| 2026-05-31 | First post-merge refresh — PR #112 merged at `7f3e6ce`; dashboard hash recomputed `9c31e4978c3d` → `5a077d17765f` | Refreshed via PR #113 per CLAUDE.md §12.2. |
| 2026-05-31 | Recursion-stop discipline gap surfaced — PR #113 merge left dashboard stale by 1 commit; §12.2 as written would recurse | Codified at PR #114 via §12.2.1 termination clause + §12.1 step 6 carve-out. |
| 2026-05-31 | First terminating refresh per §12.2.1 — PR #114 merged at `7da53e5`; this PR is the terminating event | Single-file dashboard-only refresh; does NOT trigger another refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `5a077d17765f` → `9bd06cb83b73`. |
| 2026-05-31 | Second terminating refresh — PR #116 bundled change merged at `63c4464`; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `9bd06cb83b73` → `12f34637fd3a`. |
| 2026-05-31 | Third terminating refresh — PR #118 NotebookLM skill setup merged at `65ed646`; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `12f34637fd3a` → `47c763cb4fb3`. |

| 2026-05-31 | Fifth terminating refresh — PR #122 SessionStart audit hook (enforcement layer) merged at `27bfeaf`; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `6283a744645e` → `82ce25e90fd5`. From this PR forward, audits auto-fire at every session start. |
| 2026-05-31 | Fresh-session reconciliation — local `main` found 13 commits stale (showed `#106`) vs `origin/main` `#123`; SessionStart hook not yet on local main so no auto-orient | Fast-forwarded local main; reset to `origin/main` `9f1bbf4` after parallel process pushed equivalent post-#122 refresh (#123); identical-tree sibling discarded. No divergence created. |
| 2026-05-31 | Sixth terminating refresh — PR #108 R-IF-108 audit merged at `54337c1`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged by on-main hook; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `82ce25e90fd5` → `a9f8cc1bd85d`. R-IF-108 closed; next action recomputed to R-IF-109. |

| 2026-05-31 | Eighth terminating refresh — PR #110 R-IF-110 CXA v2.18 (design-phase) merged at `2f14604`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `25d4b36d4359` → `17fe5dac2209`. R-IF-110 closed; next action recomputed to R-IF-111 (last in-flight entry). Downstream `CLAUDE.md` §1.1 count cascade (107→105) flagged as owed hygiene arc per CXA v2.18 §0.9 FM-2 deferral. |
| 2026-05-31 | Ninth terminating refresh — PR #111 R-IF-111 OD plan v2.27 (design-phase) merged at `fdf120b`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `17fe5dac2209` → `a51d65ed22a2`. R-IF-111 closed — **in-flight chain #108→#109→#110→#111 fully cleared this session**. Next action recomputed to the owed hygiene cascade (CLAUDE.md §1.1 aggregate 107→105 + harness-od refresh), R-002 fallback after. |
| 2026-05-31 | Tenth terminating refresh — PR #128 R-IF-HYGIENE-CXA-COUNT-CASCADE merged at `3ba4fae`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `a51d65ed22a2` → `adb1e71359dd`. Hygiene cascade closed (canonical pointers now read 105). **All in-flight + deferred-hygiene work cleared this session.** Next action recomputed to **R-002** (substantive phase-7 substitution-retirement survey — recommend a fresh decision before opening). |
| 2026-05-31 | Eleventh terminating refresh — PR #130 R-002 Surface-I decomposition merged at `6f8dd66`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `adb1e71359dd` → `7f251d6c7cc5`. R-002 RESOLVED (7 non-RETIRED rows mapped to R-NNN; R-001/R-004 reconciled stale→RESOLVED). Next action recomputed to **R-003** (producer-site lifts, ~7 sites; substantive phase-7 cross-axis impl — recommend fresh decision + advisor before opening). **Survey-surfaced finding:** the roadmap §5.2 was authored 2026-05-31 with R-001/R-004 as RETIRE-READY-awaiting-deployment, but OD-5/AS-8d had been RETIRED via mech-β at batches 31-32 (2026-05-28) — a 3-day-stale authoring error, now corrected. |

| 2026-05-31 | Twelfth terminating refresh — PR #132 R-003 orientation-checkpoint merged at `7c79fb4`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `7f251d6c7cc5` → `754826ddff19`. Next action UNCHANGED at **R-003** but now **ACTIVE-ORIENTATION-COMPLETE** with a resume pointer to `.harness/R-003-checkpoint.md` — a fresh session (`/clear` → hook → `continue`) resumes at Cluster A without re-deriving. Demonstrates the **stop-short seamless-resume** discipline: a paused phase-7 entry persists its orientation as a checkpoint artifact + entry sub-status + dashboard pointer. |

| 2026-05-31 | Thirteenth terminating refresh — PR #134 roadmap §3 schema amendment merged at `f8572b3`; `[ROADMAP DRIFT] action=§12.3` flagged; §12.2 owed follow-on refresh | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `754826ddff19` → `1c852278bfc9`. Next action UNCHANGED at **R-003 Cluster A**. §3 now declares the `resume:` field + `satisfied:<date>` advisor value + checkpoint-on-pause rule (status enum kept closed); R-003 entry reconciled to schema-legal `ACTIVE`. Closes the §3↔§5 drift the operator caught (3 off-schema constructs landed at #132 before the schema sanctioned them — schema-first discipline restored). |

| 2026-05-31 | **R-003 RESOLVED** — Cluster A (#136 `5e4a112`) + Cluster B (#137 `c339728`) merged; substantive roadmap PR (this) marks R-003 → RESOLVED + R-001-h-t-is-2-retired BLOCKED → ACTIVE | Bundled change (Project_Roadmap_v1.md + dashboard) → NOT a terminating refresh per §12.2.1; title drops the `ops: roadmap status refresh` prefix; **follow-on terminating refresh owed**. Hash `1c852278bfc9` → `03714383e971` (state at `c339728`, pre-this-PR-merge). Next action re-derived: **R-001-h-t-is-2-retired** (IS-2 producer cascade complete; file the PARTIAL → RETIRED retirement event). |

| 2026-05-31 | Fourteenth terminating refresh — PR #138 substantive R-003-close refresh merged at `a943caf`; §12.2 owed follow-on | Single-file dashboard-only refresh per §12.2.1. Hash `03714383e971` → `3111061f3b6b` (state at `a943caf`). Next action UNCHANGED at **R-001-h-t-is-2-retired**. This is the recursion-stopping fixed point for the R-003 close: dashboard now lags by exactly one commit (this refresh's own merge), recognized as `lag-expected` by the next §12.1 session-start audit. |

**Audit protocol exercised across 14 terminating-refresh closures + 1 fresh-session reconciliation + 1 substantive close (R-003).** Discipline + enforcement layers operational. **R-003 RESOLVED 2026-05-31 (PR #136 + #137 + #138 substantive refresh + this terminating refresh); deterministic next-action = R-001-h-t-is-2-retired (IS-2 PARTIAL → RETIRED retirement-event filing).**

## Audit checklist (run at session start)

- [ ] `workspace_state_hash` matches computed value per recipe above
- [ ] All open PRs at GitHub appear in `In-flight`
- [ ] `recently_completed` reflects last 5 merged PRs
- [ ] `latest_retirement_batch` matches `ls .harness/phase-7d-retirement-events-batch-*.md | tail -1`
- [ ] No `R-NNN` at `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §5 has `status: ACTIVE` while its `depends_on` are not all RESOLVED (re-derive per §4)

If any check fails → HALT, route per `Project_Roadmap_v1.md` §7.1 step 4.
