# One row per arc at .harness/arc-metrics.jsonl. The load-bearing field is
# levers_active: each arc records which wall-clock levers were live when it ran,
# so efficacy is a COHORT COMPARISON, never an assertion.
# Fields carry provenance (derived / declared / unmapped) — an absent measurement
# is never recorded as a measured zero. Summary reports medians WITH RANGE:
# measured round variance is ~5x, so a bare mean misleads.
# Capture is split across two arcs so no topic worktree is ever left dirty:
# `queue` (at arc closure) writes only OUTSIDE the repo, `drain` (early in the
# next arc) folds the queued rows into the tracked ledger inside that arc's PR.

# Runs `arc-exit-report` then `arc-metrics queue`; `just` stops at the first non-zero

# `arc-metrics queue`, whose contract is unchanged: omit --transcript when no transcript

# under `sh -cu` (positional-arguments, no `shell` set): POSIX only — `shift 3` then
# `"$@"`, never `${@:4}`; each line is its own shell, so a shift is local to its line.
# The tail is checked BEFORE anything runs: `--pr` is bound to the first positional, and

# C-HE-22 reviewer-concurrency probe (U-HE-35): >=5 samples at each of N in {1,2,4}

# U-HE-34 r4 NOTE: no session-layer result_capture recorder exists. The C-HE-27 §1
# process-exit vs log-write divergence is internal to the reviewer process — a
# synchronous in-recipe tee returns only after the log is flushed, so two session
# timestamps around it would measure one event. The split's recorder is registered
# as wrapper-internal work on B-218 (an earlier `review-log-settle` polling recipe
# was removed for exactly this reason).

# Advisory CodeRabbit review. This is optional and complements, not replaces,
# `just codex-review` and CI. Run after a meaningful diff exists.

# Headless overnight autonomous runner (U-HK-15). Turns loop mode ON, then re-invokes
# `claude -p` in a BOUNDED loop until a genuine gate (halt marker) or the iteration cap.
# Approvals flow through the U-HK-12 permission guard (no --dangerously-skip-permissions).
# `just loop` runs for real; `just loop --dry-run` exercises the loop without calling claude;
# `just loop --max 10` caps iterations. Review the shared loop_status.md after a run.
# Custom multi-word prompt: the env var route still works and predates the "$@" fix:
#   HARNESS_LOOP_PROMPT="do X then Y" just loop

# Not to be confused with `just loop` (U-HK-15's separate overnight `claude -p`
# runner) or `just codex-loop-*` (the Codex autonomous-arc gate ledger). These two
# recipes run the EXACT commands the loop-start / loop-stop SKILL.md files
# document, giving a shell-invocable path to the same guardrailed auto-approve /
# Stop-continue tier (U-HK-12 / U-HK-14) without going through the Skill tool.

# Turn ON loop mode (see .claude/skills/loop-start/SKILL.md for the full contract).
