# Hermetic doc witness for U-HE-39 (spec-he-loop-lanes C-HE-01 / C-HE-14 / C-HE-21 / C-HE-34 /
# C-HE-35 and §8 AC#7). The four in-scope loop-skill carriers must: state the lane model at
# N ≥ 2 with no N=2 literal cap; carry the C-HE-14 rejected/blocked table byte-exact from the
# spec; cite live carriers for invariants #5/#14 and state #16 void; record the Part D
# non-goals and the K5–K8 dispositions; and name no numeric round cap.
#
# Every normative claim is pinned WHOLE, matched against the carrier with its whitespace
# flattened, so a sentence that wraps across lines or a list item's indent is one searchable
# string. A fragment needle leaves every clause past it invertible with the witness green:
# the merge-gate witness lens found that twice on this unit — K5/K7/K8 pinned only by their
# `- **Kn —` bullet (round 1), then K7's "shadow mode only" clause left outside a first-half
# needle (round 2). For a doc witness the mutation that matters is negating a clause, not
# deleting a line.
#
# The round-cap scan matches spelled numbers as well as digits — the cap this unit recast
# read "ten rounds", which the plan's digits-only pattern passed.
#
# Usage: test_skill_lanes_docs.sh [root]   (default: this checkout). The root argument lets the
# witness run against an older tree (e.g. `git archive origin/main`) to confirm it is red there.

TL|N ≥ 2 lanes build concurrently in isolated worktrees, each with its own gates and reviewers, and land through exactly one merge door, one arc at a time (C-HE-01 §1).
TL|N is a dial, not a constant (C-HE-01 §2).
TL|The recipe below walks two lanes, A and B, because the serial rule is pairwise: a third lane waits behind B exactly as B waits behind A.
TL|Throughput: well under N×; merges serialize; trailing lanes re-gate on head change — **prior, not measurement** until AC#10 (C-HE-28) produces a baseline.
TL|"Four lanes, four times the arcs" is exactly the claim this forbids; nothing measured supports it yet.
RC|One turn of this loop is one lane's arc.
RC|N ≥ 2 lanes build concurrently in isolated worktrees, each with its own gates and reviewers, and land through exactly one merge door, one arc at a time (C-HE-01 §1); N is a dial (§2).
RC|The step-2 reservation and disjointness gate are what let a lane run beside its siblings.
RC|Throughput: well under N×; merges serialize; trailing lanes re-gate on head change — **prior, not measurement** until AC#10 (C-HE-28) produces a baseline.
MG|Each PR runs **one** bounded cycle, launched the moment the PR is pushed and run concurrently with CI.
MG|- An accepted **P1** blocks until fixed. Raised in pass 2 it triggers the escalation; raised in the escalation or in pass 3, fix and commit it and pass 3 re-runs.
MG|- An accepted **P2** raised in pass 1, pass 2 or the escalation is fixed before pass 3 runs.
MG|- An accepted P2 first raised **in pass 3**, and every **P3 or prose** finding from any pass, goes into ONE follow-up row for the arc in `.harness/forward-register.yaml` — not fixed in this PR, never a pass of its own.
MG|**The stop.** A P1 still unfixed after pass 3 — its re-run raised one again — stops the arc: the gate refuses further passes (`BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`).
MG|Nothing merges past a known P1.
MG|Invariants bind by live carriage (C-HE-21 §2), not by an appeal to their number.
MG|- **#5 is live** (no verdict inferred from absence) in this skill's `## Parsing — fail closed` and in `ship-pr`'s `## Pre-merge gate — CI green + decorrelated 3-lens review (before the merge door)`.
MG|- **#14 is C-HE-19**: CANCELLED is INCOMPLETE, never green — carried by `ship-pr`'s post-merge CI check and by `tools/merge_door.py`.
MG|- **invariant #16 is void**: C-HE-21 §2 found no concurrent-reviewer-cap carrier in `.claude/`, `tools/`, `justfile` or CLAUDE.md. It throttles neither lenses nor lanes.
MG|A later appeal to a numbered invariant cites its live carrier the same way, or it does not bind.
MG|One bounded cycle per PR (C-HE-21 §1, v1.9 X9a): no review runs past pass 3 without a recorded operator decision, and no mechanized check is cited as grounds for skipping a pass (C-HE-31, v1.9 X9b).
MG|No eval-harness / model-judge as a governance gate (C-HE-21 §4).
MG|- **K5 —** structured findings require location, observed evidence, expected contract and a reproduction basis (the C-HE-24 shape); admissible alternatives are optional, not mandated.
MG|- **K6 —** dropped: a reviewer never acquires authority to suppress its own finding by self-classifying its scope. A lens may record scope metadata; suppression belongs to a second decorrelated lens, a deterministic rule, or a logged operator override, and every suppression leaves an audit row. Ambiguous scope blocks.
MG|- **K7 —** routing by arc type and finding class is deferred until their predictiveness is measured (C-HE-26 §3); shadow mode only, if run at all.
MG|- **K8 —** a blocking post-edit hook is admitted only for fast, deterministic, low-false-positive checks at a stable boundary (C-HE-31 §3), not on every intermediate edit.
SP|The review is ONE bounded cycle per PR (spec v1.9 X9a), and it starts the moment the PR is pushed — **concurrent with CI, not after it**.
SP|**Merge condition: CI green at the final head AND pass 3 clean** → merge without HIL
SP|Keep the unit near ~300 changed non-test lines; above that, split it into its own arcs BEFORE pass 1 — every full-diff pass of the cycle reads the whole diff again.
SP|These are refusals, not gaps. Each will look like a speed fix at the moment an arc is dragging, and each was priced and rejected on evidence:
SP|- **No review past the cycle without a recorded decision.** The bounded cycle is the cap (v1.9 X9b struck the old no-round-cap and no-collapsing-review-layers refusals: passes 2 and 3 are deliberately narrower than pass 1).
SP|- **No best-of-N** / parallel variant generation as a speed fix — a measured null result at this model's temperature.
SP|- **No fast mode for throughput** — 6× the price for 2.5× the throughput, and it would disturb the 98.0% cache-read the token economics rest on.
SP|- **No agent framework** for mechanization (CLAUDE.md §3.2 framework-pull discipline).
