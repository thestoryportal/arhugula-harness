"""B-215 admission gate for the review loop: attestations in, one decision out.

Every `just review-with-failover` invocation passes through `admit()` before any
reviewer subprocess starts ([LAW:single-enforcer] — codex_review.main() is the one
seam both channels share). The gate converts the review loop's authoring-time
disciplines from instruction-following into refusals:

- CURRENCY: every admission requires the current bytes (head + diff digest via
  `rw.code_binding`, the same formula the reviewer binding uses,
  [LAW:one-source-of-truth]) to carry a sweep-run attestation — a preflight or a
  sweep bound to exactly this diff. A REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE round reviewed nothing
  and never satisfies it (codex r2 P1).
- OBLIGATIONS: every finding_id ever recorded for the arc (both loop producers —
  round numbers are per-producer scales, so round arithmetic is incoherent across
  them, codex r2 P1) must be answered by some sweep attestation before the next
  round is admitted; refusals enumerate the unanswered ids.
- TERMINATION (the C-HE-21 §1 v1.5-X5 checkpoint, operator-ratified): review
  invocations spent — distinct (producer, round) pairs — beyond the budget refuse
  until a RECORDED decision continues or holds. Never an auto-stop: continuation is
  unbounded via auditable ask-gated extensions, not env flags
  ([LAW:no-mode-explosion]), and the refusal carries the late-round-productivity
  counter-evidence for the decider.

A refusal is NOT a review terminal: C-HE-16 §3 closes that enum at
{APPROVE, BLOCK, REVIEWER_UNAVAILABLE}, and a refused invocation never begins —
no C-HE-24 row is written, no round outcome is recorded, the wrapper exits 3
behind its own distinct stderr line (`codex-review: GATE_REFUSED (<code>)`).
Since U-HE-49 (C-HE-21 §1 X6b) the logged launch step (`launch` verb, invoked by
`just review-with-failover-logged` before the wrapper process is created) reads
the same decision at the launch seam and mints per-attempt round-log names, so a
refused launch spends no reviewer call and claims no write-once round name.

State lives at `.harness/review_loop_gate_state.json` — local and gitignored,
same class as codex_loop's state: transient loop progress, never a tracked
artifact. Round history is deliberately NOT stored here: it derives from the
C-HE-24 gate log, the same source `round_n_for` mints from. The invariant that
follows ([LAW:one-source-of-truth], tested): losing or corrupting the state file
only TIGHTENS the gate (attestations vanish, rounds do not), so attest verbs may
loudly re-initialize a corrupt file — the safe direction — while `admit()` on a
corrupt file refuses (an unreadable state must never read as clean,
[LAW:no-silent-failure]).

Single-writer: the arc-serial holder discipline (one lane per arc) excludes
concurrent writers of the state file; appends are read-rewrite, not CAS. The same
discipline flow-excludes the admit-to-emission window (two concurrent wrapper
invocations for one arc) AND the admit-to-review-binding window inside one
invocation (HEAD moving between `admit()` and `run_codex_review`'s own
`compute_binding`, or between the primary and the failover child): the loop is
serial within its lane and blocked on its own foreground subprocess, and round
minting itself (`round_n_for`) carries the identical documented residual,
registered to U-HE-19/21 — the gate adds no new window and holds no lock.

Trust boundary (the u-he-33 `_record_detection` precedent, reaffirmed here): the
gate enforces DISCIPLINE against drift, not security against an agent with local
write access to this checkout — such an agent could edit this module, the gate log,
or the guard itself; fabricating attestation state is out of scope beyond the loud
containment refusals above. The `review-attest-budget` verb stays ask-gated so the
sanctioned path to more rounds is operator-visible; the filesystem is not a
sanctioned path.
