"""C-HE-24 common finding record and its `Finding` projection.

Every finding-class row (reviewer verdicts, deterministic checks, adjudications,
shadow-trial markers, equivalence proofs, gate demotions) carries the ratified
8-field core plus the row envelope and is appended to
``.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`` (C-HE-23 §2). ``.harness/arc-metrics.jsonl``
carries only ``record_kind=arc`` rows and never uses this module's emitter.

Adjudication is append-only (C-HE-24 §5): a later disposition is a new
``finding_adjudication`` row with the same ``finding_id``; readers reduce to
the last row. The write-time checks below are the enforcement of the "reviewer
is never authoritative for disposition" rule -- not prose.
