"""C-HE-29 shadow trial: the second reviewer's lens runs live, OFF the blocking path; its value
is measured from `merge-gate-log.jsonl` rows alone. The kill rule is pre-committed (n=30 scored
rounds; kill if fewer than 2 unique catches) with its operating characteristics stated. Wall
clock is NOT a kill criterion.

Vocabulary (C-HE-24 §2, C-HE-29 §2):
- a SCORED round is a distinct (arc_id, round_n) carrying a `finding` or `no_finding` row from the
  lens (round numbers restart per arc, so round_n alone would under-count across arcs);
- a BLOCKING reviewer is a loop producer or a merge-gate lens — never an operational producer
  (merge-door rows, the concurrency probe), whose rows are not reviews;
- a UNIQUE catch is a lens finding whose LAST row is an accepted adjudication with
  `unique_catch=true`, and whose (head_sha, location, finding_type) no blocking reviewer also
  reported; a later `rejected` MUST NOT count (Invariants);
- the SAMPLE is the first n scored rounds in APPEND order (the log's ordering authority per
  C-HE-24 §5; emitter timestamps may regress), frozen: a round scored after the n-th never
  enters the count, so a late catch cannot flip kill → keep;
- the RULE (n, threshold) is read from the lens's LAST config row on the log when one exists,
  so an amendment is itself a row and the decision stays reproducible from rows alone.

The trial's authorship premise: the diff under review is Claude-authored, so the blocking
reviewer is codex and the gemini shadow lens is a SECOND family. Where Gemini is already the
blocking reviewer (a Codex-authored change; `just gemini-review` on the blocking path) there is
no second family to measure and the carriers do not run the shadow (codex r5 P2) — which is also
why MODEL_FAMILIES names gemini and anthropic, never openai, as the families under trial.

`adjudicate` is the ONE production writer of `unique_catch` for the lens ([LAW:single-enforcer]);
it derives the value and appends under the same log lock ([LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling]).
