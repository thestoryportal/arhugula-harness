"""Tests for the arc-metrics ledger (B-170).

The load-bearing property under test is FAIL-CLOSED: an absent measurement must
never be recorded as a measured zero, and "could not look" must never be
reported as "looked and found nothing". Every test below has a mutation probe
noted -- revert the guard it covers and the test must red.
