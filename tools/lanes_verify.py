"""Spec §8.1 verification manifest as data + the umbrella runners (spec-he-loop-lanes).

`just lanes-verify` runs every row. `just lanes-phase0-check` runs rows tagged `phase0`
and treats a skip as a failure (C-HE-13 §1: an implicit precondition is not a gate).
`just mutation-probe-coverage-check` asserts every row marked mutation-probe has a PINNED
probe result in `.harness/mutation-probe-log.jsonl` (the run log `tools/mutation_probe.py`
appends on every exit). Only the three named environment skip reasons are legal; "slow" is
never one. Rows are appended by the unit that lands each artifact; keep them in §8.1 order.

    # assertion only -- NOT via its numerator, because `affected_arcs` is a set keyed
    # by arc_id, so duplicate rows for one arc cannot move that cell (corrected from
    # the merge-gate witness-adequacy lens on PR #1523); (b) widening the drift
    # predicate back to either carrier -> test_drift_detection_binds_to_producer_only;

    # test_lane_cohort_medians_exclude_lower_bound_rows and

    # that could not have run as described — one against a test whose fixture made it
    # unfailable, and one (a cohort-size denominator) against a test deleted when the

#: `# mutation-probe: <desc>` binds the annotated test to its default target -- the test's
#: sibling module (`tools/test_x.py` -> `tools/x.py`; `tools/hooks/test_x.sh` -> `.../x.sh`);
#: `# mutation-probe(<repo-relative path>): <desc>` names the target explicitly (a test that
#: probes another module, e.g. `test_review_wrapper.py` -> `review_wrapper_common.py`). A pin
#: counts only if its logged `file` IS that target (codex R3/R4 P2: a pin credited to the test
#: node alone could come from probing an unrelated file). The LINES the annotation names stay a
#: human contract -- the gate proves a live pin of the named file exists for the annotated test.
# An annotation binds the NEXT `def test_*`, across any decorator lines between -- including
# a multi-line `@pytest.mark.parametrize(...)` (codex u-sr-09 r5: the single-line-decorator
# form silently dropped a parametrized test from `required_probes`). A line starting with
# `def ` or `async def ` that is not a test stops the scan (the annotation is then bound
# to nothing); an `async def test_*` binds like a `def` (codex r7: the bridge had walked
# through it to the next test). The bridge accepts only DECORATOR-shaped lines -- starting
# with `@`, whitespace (a continuation), `)`, `#`, or empty -- so a class, an assignment or
# any other statement between an annotation and the next test ends the scan instead of
# carrying the annotation over to it (codex r8). The bridge and the `def` are a LOOKAHEAD:
# a match consumes only its own annotation line, so two stacked annotations above one
# test each bind it (two required targets), instead of the first swallowing the second
