"""Re-cluster the live gate log against the skill's defect classes.

The checklist in SKILL.md is a distilled map of `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`;
the log is the one authority and only grows. This prints (a) current per-class
counts — compare them to the counts baked into SKILL.md and refresh the text when
they have moved meaningfully — and (b) the most recent findings that match NO
known class: those are candidates for a new class, surfaced mechanically instead
of waiting for recall. Advisory by design: always exits 0, output is for the
agent running the preflight, never a gate.

# One definition per class, mirroring SKILL.md's class sections. When a class is
# added or reworded there, extend this table in the same commit (the counts the
# skill cites are derived HERE, so a drifted table silently mis-buckets, and a
# class absent here can never leave the unmatched bucket — it reads as a
# new-class candidate forever). Classes 11–14 were added by U-SR-01; 11 had been
# carried in SKILL.md since U-HE-47 without a row here.
#
# A row is EITHER one pattern — any alternative IS the class — OR a TUPLE of patterns
# that must ALL match, for the two classes that name two conditions in their own title.
# The conjunction was first written as `(?=.*A)(?=.*B)` and that was a product type
# squeezed into a string: with `re.search` the unanchored lookaheads retry both
# whole-suffix scans at every character, costing 12.3s and 17.4s on the committed corpus
# against under 0.11s for every other row, and degrading as this append-only log grows
# (codex r5 P2, reproduced before absorbing). Two independent searches are linear and say
# what they mean.
#
# UNDER-matching is the safe direction and is chosen deliberately throughout: a missed
# row stays in the unmatched new-class discovery pile, while a false match silently
# removes it from that pile. Prefer to miss.
#
# Known precision bound, named rather than chased: a conjunction still matches on
# CO-OCCURRENCE, so a row pairing an unrelated command term with an unrelated loop term
# can land in class 13, and a finding whose text DISCUSSES a class necessarily contains
# that class's vocabulary. This tool is advisory by its own docstring and multi-match is
# by design; successive regex layers were measured trading one imprecision for another
# without converging, so the bound is documented here rather than chased further.
