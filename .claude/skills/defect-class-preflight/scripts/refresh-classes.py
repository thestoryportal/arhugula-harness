"""Re-cluster the live gate log against the skill's defect classes.

The checklist in SKILL.md is a distilled map of `.harness/merge-gate-log.jsonl`;
the log is the one authority and only grows. This prints (a) current per-class
counts — compare them to the counts baked into SKILL.md and refresh the text when
they have moved meaningfully — and (b) the most recent findings that match NO
known class: those are candidates for a new class, surfaced mechanically instead
of waiting for recall. The report is advisory by design: it always exits 0 and its
output is for the agent running the preflight, never a gate.

The `classify` verb is the one consumer-facing seam: `tools/review_loop_gate.py`
feeds it an arc's outstanding reviewer findings at sweep template/attest time, and a
finding it leaves unmatched owes the author an `intake:` disposition there (SKILL.md
"When a reviewer catches what this sweep missed"). That verb exits non-zero on
malformed input — the gate must never read 'could not classify' as 'unmatched'.

# One definition per class, mirroring SKILL.md's class sections. When a class is
# added or reworded there, extend this table in the same commit (the counts the
# skill cites are derived HERE, so a drifted table silently mis-buckets, and a
# class absent here can never leave the unmatched bucket — it reads as a
# new-class candidate forever). Classes 11–14 were added by U-SR-01; 11 had been
# carried in SKILL.md since U-HE-47 without a row here.
#
# A row is EITHER one pattern — any alternative IS the class — OR a TUPLE of patterns
# that must ALL match, for the two classes that name two conditions in their own title.
# The conjunction was first written as `(?=.*A)(?=.*B)` and that was a product type
# squeezed into a string: with `re.search` the unanchored lookaheads retry both
# whole-suffix scans at every character, costing 12.3s and 17.4s on the committed corpus
# against under 0.11s for every other row, and degrading as this append-only log grows
# (codex r5 P2, reproduced before absorbing). Two independent searches are linear and say
# what they mean.
#
# UNDER-matching is the safe direction and is chosen deliberately throughout: a missed
# row stays in the unmatched new-class discovery pile, while a false match silently
# removes it from that pile. Prefer to miss.
#
# Known precision bound, named rather than chased: a conjunction still matches on
# CO-OCCURRENCE, so a row pairing an unrelated command term with an unrelated loop term
# can land in class 13, and a finding whose text DISCUSSES a class necessarily contains
# that class's vocabulary. This tool is advisory by its own docstring and multi-match is
# by design; successive regex layers were measured trading one imprecision for another
# without converging, so the bound is documented here rather than chased further.
#
# Vocabulary evaluated and LEFT OUT (so it is not re-proposed): `drift` for class 2
# (handoff-s2 §2 B, 2026-09-16). At that day's corpus of 2,103 findings, 35 rows said
# "drift" and 30 of them matched no class-2 term — but read, they are contract drift
# (a witness that codifies a spec departure), configuration drift, roadmap drift and the
# arc-metrics `drift` cohort/fixture; prose decay in the class-2 sense was at most 2
# rows under any prose-adjacent form tried. A bare `\bdrift` would have moved the 30
# out of the new-class intake pile, the wrong direction under the policy above (codex
# r1 P2 on the class-2-drift-extension arc). The recurring "test codifies the drift"
# shape that note pointed at is now class 16 — measured at 14 unmatched rows on
# 2026-09-17 — and is still not a class-2 term.
