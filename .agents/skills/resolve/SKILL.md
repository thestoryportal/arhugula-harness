# Canonical Claude Workflow Bridge

Read `.claude/skills/resolve/SKILL.md` completely from the workspace root before acting, including every reference it routes for the task. That canonical skill body is the full workflow; this Codex entrypoint does not summarize, trim, or replace it. Resolve its relative references from the canonical skill directory.

Apply these runner translations only:

- Root `AGENTS.md` is the Codex instruction entrypoint; targeted `CLAUDE.md` sections remain canonical lineage.
- Claude `Agent` or `Task` fan-out means fresh Codex subagents or `codex exec` contexts with self-contained briefs, subject to current delegation policy.
- `AskUserQuestion` means the available Codex user-input surface, and only for a genuine operator-owned fork.
- When Codex is the author, any canonical claim that Codex is out-of-family translates to Antigravity via `just gemini-review`; when Claude is the author, `just codex-review` remains out-of-family.
- Claude's transcript-brief-review judgment (a fresh-context Agent reviewer briefed on the session; CLAUDE.md §13.1) translates to an ISOLATED fresh-context reviewer in this venue — a separate `codex exec` call handed the same written session brief, never the interactive controller reviewing its own work — plus the required out-of-family artifact review; where the venue's approval surface exposes no isolated exec shape (unattended loops), the obligation routes to the Claude-venue transcript-brief Agent review handed the same written brief — a merge-gate lens is not a discharge (it never sees the brief; doc-only changes skip that gate) — and the routing is recorded: never discharged by controller self-review, never silently skipped; never silently drop either function. DECISION-TIME EXCEPTION for this skill: its flow consumes the brief-reviewer's output AT the decision (votes are compared / deltas need both reviewers' acceptance before applying), so the deferred-routing fallback above cannot satisfy it — where this venue cannot produce the isolated second vote while the fork is live, the FORK itself defers (record DEFERRED-HIL / leave the delta unapplied for the operator or the Claude-venue loop); never decide on one vote, never let the controller supply the missing vote.
- Claude-only scratch paths translate to a safe `/tmp` or ignored workspace scratch path. All Git, CI, worktree, paid-call, secret, and destructive-action guardrails remain binding.
