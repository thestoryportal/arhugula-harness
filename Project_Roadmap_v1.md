# Project Roadmap v1

*Workspace-root roadmap delivering deterministic next-action derivation. Loaded at every session start via CLAUDE.md §12. Refreshed via `.harness/roadmap_status.md` dashboard.*

---

## 0. Change note + scope

**What this is.** A machine-readable (by Claude) roadmap that lets a fresh session pick its next action from a structured queue without operator AskUserQuestion. Per-action discipline encoding (skill, posture, advisor/council requirements, verification shape, close shape) means future-Claude knows not only *what* to do but *how* to do it correctly.

**What this is not.** A planning narrative. A status report. A re-synthesis of design substrate. A commitment device against execution drift (workspaces drift; this doc detects + handles drift, doesn't prevent it).

**Locus rationale.** Workspace root, not `design-substrate/`. Roadmaps are *process-substrate* — refreshing them at every PR merge is the design. Placing them under `design-substrate/` would trap each refresh behind X-AL-3 guard + design-phase posture + clearance marker = same failure mode as the checkpoint convention (advisory drift). Process-substrate lives at workspace root or `.harness/`; design-substrate lives at `design-substrate/`.

**Why this exists.** Operator directive 2026-05-31: *"I no longer ask whats next. After each chunk of work Claude knows with certainty which next work to proceed to and what disciplines are to be applied and executed for each."* The roadmap delivers this; partial delivery (no derivation rule, or no discipline encoding, or no drift detection) is failure.

**Success criterion.** Close a session. Open a fresh one tomorrow. Read only `CLAUDE.md` + this roadmap + `.harness/roadmap_status.md`. Point at a specific R-NNN and execute without asking the operator. If you catch yourself wanting to AUQ "should I do X or Y" — the discipline encoding or derivation rule is not sharp enough; iterate this doc before continuing execution.

**Versioning.** v1 = scaffolding (this PR). Per-workstream atomic decomposition for §IV–§IX is incremental (future PRs). Workflow v1.14 amendment cataloguing roadmap-driven discipline is a sibling arc.

## 1. Surface synthesis (compressed)

Ten surfaces of remaining work between current state and Phase 7 closure + Phase 8 graduation. Each surface gets an R-NNN ID block in §5.

| § | Surface | R-NNN block | One-line scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | Phase 7 axis-clean | R-001..R-099 | Atomic-unit landings + substitution retirement until §1.3 closure criterion met |
| II | MVP-operator-usable | R-100..R-199 | `harness run` exercises a real workflow at SOLO_DEVELOPER tier against ≥1 LLM provider with audit-ledger emission |
| III | CI substrate | R-200..R-299 | GitHub Actions for pytest + pyright + ruff + workspace-wide test matrix; X-AL-3 guard already landed |
| IV | Multi-LLM maturity | R-300..R-399 | Provider capability discovery; capability-aware abstraction exercise; mixed-provider workflow |
| V | Multi-deployment surfaces | R-400..R-499 | LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT → SELF_HOSTED_SERVER → MANAGED_CLOUD; sandbox tier wiring per ADR-D2 / ADR-F4 |
| VI | Multi-tenant | R-500..R-599 | `RuntimeConfig.tenant_id` non-default deployments; `persona_tier` non-SOLO_DEVELOPER deployments; redaction policy per §C-OD-13 §13.1 |
| VII | Process discipline | R-600..R-699 | Workflow doc evolution; species/sub-species catalogue; pattern bake-in; clearance marker maturity |
| VIII | Phase 8 retirement criteria | R-700..R-799 | All 49 substitutions either RETIRED or RETIRED-AS-BOUNDED-RESIDUAL with documented rationale per X-AL-2 |
| IX | External integrations | R-800..R-899 | Real external MCP servers; managed_agents primitive (deferred per AS-8f); Files API (deferred per AS-8e) |
| X | Existential / research | R-900..R-999 | Open architectural questions; speculative arcs; research-corpus extensions |
| XI | Operator tooling / observability | R-XI-NN | Human-facing dashboards, status pages, CI-deployed observability surfaces; NOT for Claude consumption (Claude reads `.harness/roadmap_status.md` directly) |

**Decomposition status:** §I + §II + §III + §VII + §XI have R-NNN actions populated at §5. §IV–§VI + §VIII–§X are named with decomposition-owed markers per §9.

## 2. Sequencing rationale + dependency graph

**Multipliers (do first, unlock more):**

1. **CI substrate (§III)** — lifts the cadence ceiling. Without CI, every PR merge depends on local-test discipline; with CI, parallel branches + pre-merge validation = ~2-3× cadence on the no-shared-state arcs.
2. **MVP-operator-usable (§II)** — unlocks every X-AL-2 second-conjunct closure that requires real workflow execution. AS-8d + OD-5 + future RETIRE-READY transits gate on MVP. Without MVP, the RETIRE-READY bucket grows indefinitely.
3. **Multi-deployment surfaces (§V)** — gates ~40-60% of remaining substitution retirements (tier-conditional emission, multi-tenant redaction, sandbox tier 2+3). LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT-only deployments cannot exercise the full substitution-retirement gradient.

**Dependency graph (high-level):**

```
§III CI substrate ────┬─────────────► §II MVP-usable ──┬──► §V multi-deployment ──┬──► §VI multi-tenant
                      │                                │                          │
                      └─► §I axis-clean ──► §VIII Phase 8 retirement              │
                                                                                  ▼
                                                                          §VII process maturity
                                                                          (parallel arc; not gating)

§IV multi-LLM ──┐
§IX external ───┤── all gate on §II MVP-usable
                ┘
§X existential — research, no execution dependency

§XI operator tooling — gates on §III CI substrate (auto-regenerate);
                       parallel arc after §III opens
```

**Hard dependencies (must respect):**

- Any RETIRED transit gated on X-AL-2 second conjunct (substituted H_E surface no longer invoked) requires §II MVP-usable.
- Any tier-conditional retirement (OD sampler envelope; OD redaction; sandbox tier 2+3) requires §V multi-deployment.
- Any cross-provider capability discovery requires §IV multi-LLM.
- Phase 8 closure (§VIII) requires all 49 substitutions accounted for.

**Soft dependencies (cross-cutting but not strictly blocking):**

- Process discipline maturity (§VII) compounds at every arc — defer indefinitely and the workflow doc accumulates uncatalogued patterns.
- CI substrate (§III) enables faster execution of every other surface but is not strictly blocking.

---

## 3. Discipline-encoding schema (the load-bearing section)

Every R-NNN entry uses this schema. **Read this section once, then read §5 entries pattern-matched against it.**

```yaml
R-NNN:
  title: <one-line scope>
  surface: <§I..§X>
  status: <PROPOSED|ACTIVE|BLOCKED|RESOLVED|DEFERRED|CANCELLED>
  depends_on: [R-NNN, ...]    # all must be RESOLVED before this can be ACTIVE
  blocks: [R-NNN, ...]        # this must be RESOLVED before these can be ACTIVE
  posture: <design-phase|phase-7|mode-agnostic|halt-route-to-operator>
  scope:
    files: [path glob, ...]   # what gets edited
    contracts: [C-XX-NN, ...] # which contracts touched (empty if none)
    cross_axis: <yes|no>      # crosses an axis boundary?
  skills:
    primary: <skill-name|null>
    secondary: [skill-name, ...]
  advisor_required: <yes|no|conditional:reason>
  council_required: <yes|no|conditional:nameable-tension>
  verification:
    shape: <e2e|integration|unit|grep|none>
    must_pass: [<assertion description>, ...]
  close_shape:
    type: <PR-merge|fork-doc-filing|retirement-event|substrate-amendment|clearance-marker>
    artifact: <expected output path or PR title pattern>
    cascade: [<downstream R-NNN to refresh>, ...]
  next_pointer: <R-NNN or null>   # if this is RESOLVED, next likely action
  notes: <free text, ≤3 lines>
```

**Field semantics:**

- **status** — PROPOSED = not yet authorized; ACTIVE = can be executed now; BLOCKED = unmet hard dependency; RESOLVED = PR merged or equivalent closure; DEFERRED = operator-decision to park; CANCELLED = scope removed (with rationale at notes).
- **depends_on** vs **blocks** — depends_on is what must close before this opens; blocks is what this opens once closed (inverse view; both populated for fast traversal both directions).
- **posture** — `design-phase` = edits `design-substrate/**`; `phase-7` = edits `harness-*/src/**`; `mode-agnostic` = workspace-operational (root, `.github/`, `.claude/`, this roadmap, status dashboard); `halt-route-to-operator` = requires operator AUQ before execution.
- **skills.primary** — invoke this first. **skills.secondary** — invoke during execution as triggered.
- **advisor_required** — `yes` = call `advisor()` before substantive work; `conditional:<reason>` = call advisor() if condition holds.
- **council_required** — `yes` = open council per `.claude/skills/council/council-orchestrator/`; `conditional:nameable-tension` = open council only if a tension between two voices can be named in advance (per workspace CLAUDE.md §10.9 amendment 1).
- **verification.shape** — `e2e` = real workflow execution; `integration` = cross-module test; `unit` = single-module test; `grep` = static verification; `none` = doc-only or process-only.
- **close_shape.cascade** — downstream R-NNN entries that should be refreshed (status check, next_pointer recompute) upon close.
- **next_pointer** — best-guess at next action upon close; the derivation rule (§4) may override if dependencies / postures changed.

**When the schema is silent.** If a field cannot be populated without orientation (e.g., dependencies on not-yet-authored substrate), set the field to `TBD:<one-line-reason>` and route to operator at execution time. Do NOT silently default to "no" or "none" — silent defaults are the failure mode.

## 4. Next-action derivation rule

**Executed by Claude at session start (per CLAUDE.md §12) and after every PR merge.**

```
def next_action(roadmap, workspace_state, session_posture):
    """
    Returns the R-NNN to execute next, or None if blocked / awaiting operator.

    workspace_state: dict computed from git HEAD + open PRs + open fork docs +
                     last-retirement-batch-count + RETIRED-count + CLAUDE.md row-set hash.
    session_posture: 'design-phase' | 'phase-7' | 'mode-agnostic' | None.
                     If None, derive from edit-scope intent or AUQ operator.
    """

    # 1. Refresh status dashboard against workspace_state.
    #    If hash mismatch with .harness/roadmap_status.md → HALT (drift detected).
    if hash(workspace_state) != roadmap_status.workspace_state_hash:
        return HALT("DRIFT_DETECTED",
                    diff=workspace_state_diff(workspace_state, dashboard))

    # 2. Build candidate queue:
    #    - status == ACTIVE
    #    - all depends_on in RESOLVED
    #    - no operator-halt-marker
    #    - posture matches session_posture (or session_posture is None and
    #      we let the candidate's posture drive the AUQ)
    candidates = [
        r for r in roadmap.actions
        if r.status == 'ACTIVE'
        and all(roadmap[d].status == 'RESOLVED' for d in r.depends_on)
        and not r.operator_halt_marker
        and (session_posture is None or r.posture == session_posture
             or r.posture == 'mode-agnostic')
    ]

    # 3. If empty, look for BLOCKED actions whose blockers just RESOLVED;
    #    flip those to ACTIVE and retry step 2.
    if not candidates:
        flipped = [r for r in roadmap.actions
                   if r.status == 'BLOCKED'
                   and all(roadmap[d].status == 'RESOLVED' for d in r.depends_on)]
        if flipped:
            for r in flipped: r.status = 'ACTIVE'
            return next_action(roadmap, workspace_state, session_posture)

    # 4. If still empty, surface to operator.
    if not candidates:
        return HALT("NO_ACTIVE_CANDIDATES", queue_size=len(roadmap.actions))

    # 5. Apply priority order (lower R-NNN first within surface;
    #    surface order = blockers-first per §2 dependency graph).
    candidates.sort(key=lambda r: (surface_priority(r.surface), r.id))

    # 6. Return top.
    return candidates[0]
```

**Priority order (surface_priority):**

1. `mode-agnostic` infrastructure (R-IF-NNN in-flight tracking; refresh-roadmap actions)
2. `§I axis-clean` — close substitutions whose dependencies are met
3. `§III CI substrate` — multiplier
4. `§II MVP-operator-usable` — multiplier
5. `§VII process discipline` — parallel arc
6. `§V multi-deployment` → `§VI multi-tenant` → `§IV multi-LLM` → `§IX external`
7. `§XI operator tooling` — parallel arc; opens after §III CI substrate baseline
8. `§VIII Phase 8` (only when most of §I closed)
9. `§X existential` (when bored, or when an arc surfaces one)

**When to depart from the rule.** Operator AUQ overrides at any step. Class 1 fork detection (§4.3 of CLAUDE.md) halts the rule and routes to design-phase back-flow. Drift detection halts immediately. The rule is not a contract — it is a discipline that fails loudly.

### 5.6 Halt-doc routings (2026-05-31 carries)

R-700 prefix used because these are halt-resolutions awaiting downstream substantive arcs.

### 5.7 Operator tooling / observability (R-XI-NN)

Surface XI = human-facing tooling. Distinct from `.harness/roadmap_status.md` which is Claude-consumed. Gates on §III CI substrate so dashboards auto-regenerate (avoiding the manual-refresh failure mode v1 hit).

```yaml
R-XI-01:
  title: Browser-based operator dashboard MVP — at-a-glance harness development status
  surface: XI
  status: PROPOSED
  depends_on: [R-200-ci-pytest-pyright-ruff-matrix]

  council_required: no
  verification:
    shape: integration
    must_pass:

      - "GitHub Pages auto-deploys roadmap.html on every main push"
      - "Dashboard surfaces: Phase 7 retirement progress bar, R-NNN status board, in-flight PRs with CI status, recently completed, operator gate inventory, drift detection log, next-action panel"
      - "Loads under 2s in modern browser"
      - "Operator can scan progress in <30 seconds without opening other tools"
  close_shape:

  notes: |
    Recommended tech stack: Python or Node generator script + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build) + vanilla JS + Chart.js or uPlot for sparklines. NO bundler at MVP — pure static HTML.
    Authored per dashboard-assessment conversation 2026-05-31. Surface XI added to roadmap at same arc.
    PROPOSED until R-200-ci-pytest baseline closes — without CI auto-deploy, this becomes manual-refresh burden (same shape as v1 dashboard bug).

R-XI-02:
  title: Dashboard dependency-graph viz + sparklines (iteration 2)

    Decide at execution time per cost + complexity tradeoff.
```
### 5.8 Phase 8 accounting (R-700..R-799)

```yaml
R-700-phase-8-substitution-accounting:
  title: All 49 substitutions accounted for — RETIRED or RETIRED-AS-BOUNDED-RESIDUAL with rationale

## 6. Operator gate inventory

Actions where genuine human decision is required (not Claude judgment). Flagged via `posture: halt-route-to-operator` in §5; enumerated here for fast scan.

| R-NNN | Gate description | Why operator-decision |
|---|---|---|
| R-001 | H_T-OD-5 RETIRE-READY → RETIRED | Operator deployment substrate not autonomous-overnight territory; Reading α (BOUNDED-RESIDUAL) requires operator AUQ |
| R-004 | H_T-AS-8d RETIRE-READY → RETIRED | Same shape as R-001 |
| R-700-phase-8-substitution-accounting | Phase 7 closure | Comprehensive scope review; per-row disposition choices |
| R-600-workflow-v1-14-amendment | Workflow doc revision | Process-doc evolution requires operator scope authorization |

**Operator-AUQ shape for halt-route actions.** Claude prepares the brief (current state, options, recommendations) and presents via AskUserQuestion. Claude does not execute the halt-route action until operator response. If session ends without response, R stays at status BLOCKED with note `awaiting-operator-AUQ-since-YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## 7. Audit cadence + drift-detection protocol

**Two mandatory audit points per session lifecycle.**

### 7.1 Session-start audit (always run before first substantive action)

1. Read `.harness/roadmap_status.md`.
2. Compute current `workspace_state_hash`:
   - `git rev-parse HEAD` (8 chars)
   - `gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName --jq '. | sort_by(.number) | map("\(.number):\(.headRefName)") | join(",")'` (sorted)
   - `ls .harness/class_1_fork_*.md .harness/class_2_fork_*.md 2>/dev/null | sort | wc -l` (open fork doc count)
   - `ls .harness/phase-7d-retirement-events-batch-*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1` (latest retirement batch)
   - SHA256 of the concatenation; first 12 chars.
3. Compare with `dashboard.workspace_state_hash`.
4. **If mismatch** → HALT, write a diff to session output, surface to operator with options:
   - (a) refresh dashboard from current state, proceed
   - (b) revert workspace to dashboard state (only if drift is uncommitted)
   - (c) operator manually resolves
5. **If match** → proceed to next-action derivation rule (§4).

### 7.2 Post-PR-merge audit (always run after every PR merge)

1. Recompute `workspace_state_hash` per §7.1.
2. Update `.harness/roadmap_status.md`:
   - `workspace_state_hash` → new value
   - `last_refreshed` → now (ISO 8601)
   - `recently_completed` → prepend (R-NNN, PR-link)
   - `in_flight` → remove merged PR, add new opened PRs
   - `next_action` → recompute via §4 rule
3. Commit the dashboard refresh as `ops: roadmap status refresh post-PR-NN`.
4. Push.

### 7.3 Drift sources (catalogued so future-Claude recognizes them)

| Drift source | How it appears | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| PR merged but dashboard not refreshed | `dashboard.recently_completed` missing the merged PR | Refresh dashboard, commit |
| New PR opened but dashboard not refreshed | `dashboard.in_flight` missing the open PR | Refresh dashboard, commit |
| Fork doc filed but dashboard not refreshed | `dashboard.open_fork_docs` count mismatch | Refresh dashboard, commit |
| Retirement batch filed but dashboard not refreshed | `dashboard.latest_retirement_batch` outdated | Refresh dashboard, commit |
| R-NNN's depends_on RESOLVED but status still BLOCKED | Stale per §4 rule step 3 | Flip status to ACTIVE, re-derive |
| R-NNN landed but not marked RESOLVED in this roadmap | The §5 entry is stale | Mark RESOLVED, refresh next_pointer |
| Operator added a new requirement not in roadmap | New R-NNN authored mid-session | Add entry at §5, refresh dashboard |
| Workspace edit by non-Claude actor (operator hand-edit) | `workspace_state_hash` mismatch | Operator confirms drift is intentional; refresh from current state |

---

## 8. Refresh + update protocol

### 8.1 When to add a new R-NNN

- Operator surfaces a new requirement → add R-NNN immediately (mode-agnostic posture; this doc is process-substrate).
- Closure of one R-NNN reveals a sub-action — add child R-NNN with `depends_on: [parent]`.
- Pattern catalogue cardinality ≥2 reaches workflow-doc promotion threshold → add an R-600 series entry.
- Surface I-X decomposition pass executes → batch-add R-NNN entries for that surface's atomic actions.

### 8.2 When to refresh an existing R-NNN

- `status` change at PR merge or upstream dependency closure.
- `depends_on` / `blocks` change at workspace state evolution.
- `verification.must_pass` change at spec/contract amendment (cascade per close_shape).
- `notes` clarification at session learning.

### 8.3 When to delete an R-NNN

Don't. Mark `CANCELLED` with rationale at `notes` instead. Provenance preserved.

### 8.4 PR labels

Add these labels (operator-discretion) for fast scan:

- `roadmap-r-nnn` — PR closes one or more R-NNN; PR body cites them.
- `roadmap-drift-detected` — PR introduces drift; dashboard refresh owed in same PR.
- `roadmap-design-extension` — adds new R-NNN entries; not just refreshing existing ones.

---

## 9. Workstream catalog

Decomposition status per surface. **`decomposed`** means R-NNN entries exist at §5. **`decomposition-owed`** means surface is named but atomic R-NNN entries pending.

| § | Surface | Decomposition status | Decomposition trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | Phase 7 axis-clean | `partially-decomposed` (R-001..R-004 + R-001-h-t-is-2-retired + R-003) | R-002 execution generates per-row R-NNN |
| II | MVP-operator-usable | `partially-decomposed` (R-100 series) | Each merged PR generates next R-NNN at this surface |
| III | CI substrate | `partially-decomposed` (R-200 series) | After R-200-ci-pytest closure, decompose §V multi-deployment dependencies |
| IV | Multi-LLM maturity | `decomposition-owed` | Triggered by R-100-mvp-real-workflow-execution closure |
| V | Multi-deployment surfaces | `decomposition-owed` | Triggered by R-100-mvp-multi-workflow-fixture-suite closure |
| VI | Multi-tenant | `decomposition-owed` | Triggered by R-400 surface decomposition |
| VII | Process discipline | `partially-decomposed` (R-600 series + R-IF-roadmap-refresh) | Cadence-driven; sweep every ~10 PRs |
| VIII | Phase 8 retirement criteria | `placeholder` (R-700-phase-8-substitution-accounting only) | Triggered when §I substitutions ≥45/49 closed |
| IX | External integrations | `decomposition-owed` | Triggered by R-300 multi-LLM decomposition |
| X | Existential / research | `decomposition-owed` | Surfaces opportunistically; not actively decomposed |
| XI | Operator tooling / observability | `partially-decomposed` (R-XI-01 + R-XI-02 + R-XI-03, all PROPOSED) | Triggered by R-200-ci-pytest-pyright-ruff-matrix closure; R-XI-01 flips PROPOSED → ACTIVE at that point |

**Decomposition-owed marker discipline.** When opening any surface for decomposition, operator AUQ required ONLY if scope is ambiguous; otherwise Claude decomposes per current workspace state. The roadmap is not a contract — it is a discipline.
